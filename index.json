[{"title":"Introduction","url":"/toolkit/introduction.html","content":" Introduction # The Digital Humanities and the Climate Crisis: A Manifesto (2021) states:\nThe digital is material. As digital humanists, every project we create, every software application we use, every piece of hardware we purchase impacts our environment. [\u0026hellip;] As humanities researchers, it is also our role to probe the values, the power structures, and the future imaginaries that underpin sustainable solutions.\nTo meet climate targets, the world needs to cut net carbon emissions by about half by 2030, and achieve net zero carbon by 2050. Globally, Information Communication Technology (ICT) already contributes 1.8% to 3.9% of greenhouse gas emissions, and is currently projected to grow significantly (Freitag et al. 2021). Transport accounts for about 14% (SLOCAT 2021), and research often involves heavy travel for conferences, meetings, and fieldwork. What can we do?\nWho is this for? # We can all play our part in a rapid and just climate transition.\nWhile we initially conceived of this Toolkit to help Digital Humanities researchers, digital tools are now so woven into academic practice that this toolkit has relevance across all the arts, humanities and social sciences. The Toolkit is for anyone who makes a website, or uses videoconferencing, or visualises data. It is for educators, students, researchers, librarians, technicians, administrators and others. We hope the information and suggestions here will empower and inspire you in your work.\nWhat does it cover? # The Minimal Computing section explores how we can reduce the carbon footprint of our digital practices. The Maximal Computing section examines computationally intensive digital tools such as Machine Learning, and offers perspectives on when these might be justifiable. Grant Writing includes recommendations on designing (or redesigning) research projects, including Data Management Plans. Working Practices offers guidance on reducing energy consumption in your day-to-day working life, including communication and shared working, travel, and publishing and preserving data. Advocating within your Institution offers tips on how to go beyond individual or project-level sustainability. The Decision Trees and Teaching sections are works-in-progress that will offer guides for making technical choices in daily work and project planning and implementing climate-oriented DH teaching. You\u0026rsquo;ll also find a brief Climate Change Primer.\nGet involved # This toolkit comes out of the Digital Humanities Climate Coalition, and in many places it reflects the concentration of our membership in the UK and Northern Europe. As of November 2022, its primary authors, in alphabetical order, are Anne Baillot, James Baker, Jenny Bunn, Michael Faerber, Charlotte Feidicker, John Moore, Christopher Ohge, Torsten Roeder, Martin Steer, Jo Lindsay Walton, Elizabeth Williamson.\nClimate change is a global issue, and we hope it will still be of use all around the world. Climate action is always work-in-progress, and we welcome your contributions and suggestions to evolve this Toolkit in the future.\nAreas we are particularly interested in developing include:\nCoverage. Widening the toolkit’s scope to cover more countries (especially in the Grant Writing section). Tools. User-friendly tools to measure impacts or support decisions. Carbon literacy. How can we get a handle on orders of magnitude, even when we can\u0026rsquo;t measure precisely? Quantification. What are the best ways to estimate or to measure emissions of digital humanities projects? Can we develop a more digital-native vocabulary of Emissions Factors? Case studies. Case studies. Have you decarbonised aspects of your work? Have you implemented moratoriums until more sustainable practices are developed? Have you adopted tools to better understand your impact? We would like to hear about what has worked well (and what hasn\u0026rsquo;t). Preservation, archiving, and curation. These areas are touched on briefly under Working Practices, but we see room for considerable expansion (or smart signposting). Systems change. Linking individual- and project-level best practice to climate justice activism and broader systems change. Get involved by collaborating on Github, joining the DHCC, or contacting Christopher Ohge, Jo Lindsay Walton, Lisa Otty, James Baker, or Marty Steer with your ideas.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY 4.0 Further reading # Baillot, Anne. 2023.

These might draw especially on the evidence and recommendations in the Working Practices and Project Planning sections. If you're interested in contributing to this section, please get in touch, or join the conversation here. Our first step below is to build a list of needs, and to signpost relevant evidence and recommendations within the toolkit. I want to organise an online event # See section on Communication Methods for more information on videoconferencing. If you are delivering the event as part of a funded project, make sure you include environmental considerations in your application. See Grant Writing for more details. As well as videoconferencing, consider what other computing processes will be involved in running your event. These may include: Creating a website. See Minimal Computing, and in particular, sections on Static Site Generators, Tips for Sustainable Websites and Critical Design and Systems Change. Emailing. See Day-to-day Working and Data Traffic. Lastly, you should consider how you will responsibly dispose of project websites, email threads etc., and how you will archive your data. See Archiving Your Data. I want to organise a hybrid event # Organising a hybrid event will involve many of the same questions as organising an online event. See above for relevant links. Additionally, you should consider: Travel Catering You may also want to consider the bigger picture of your institution’s energy procurement strategy. I want to measure carbon emissions # Consider how you might make sensible improvements even before you have measured emissions. The Project Footprinting section offers an introduction to carbon footprinting and concepts such as Emissions Factors. The CO2.js Playground is a great introduction to the CO2.js library from the Green Web Foundation, which lets you estimate website carbon intensity. The Data Carbon Scorecard is a light touch tool to help you plan a new data project. The DIMPACT tool estimates emissions associated with audiovisual streaming and other digital activities. Cloud Carbon Footprint is an open source tool that provides visibility and tooling to measure your cloud carbon emissions. Here\u0026rsquo;s a case study from ThoughtWorks. The Software Carbon Intensity Specification is a high level framework for scoring a software system\u0026rsquo;s carbon emissions. Now an ISO standard. See also this Green Software Foundation guidance on carbon efficiency, energy efficiency, hardware efficiency, measurement and reporting, and the Impact Framework. Investigate a hosting provider\u0026rsquo;s energy source with the Green Web Check. Tools like Website Carbon Calculator and Ecograder can automatically estimate a website\u0026rsquo;s carbon impact. Green Algorithms Calculator will give you a carbon estimate for a computational process based on runtime, types of cores, number of cores, model, etc. A variety of sector-specific Carbon Literacy Toolkits are available from the Carbon Literacy Project. Check out Green Coding Solutions\u0026rsquo; Green Metrics Tool, to measure the energy / CO2 consumption of software, especially containerized software. I want to create a website for a research project # Begin by factoring consideration of website creation and maintenance in your project proposal’s data management plan. See discussion of Energy Proportionality in the Grant Writing section for more details. When it comes to designing your website, you could consider factors such as Static Versus Dynamic Websites, Tips for Sustainable Websites and Critical Design and Systems Change. Additional guidance on Minimal Computing Principles may also be helpful for approaches for sustainable website design. Think about where to host your website. Consider displaying a certification, e.g. Neuto\u0026rsquo;s Digital Carbon Rating Scale. After the conclusion of the research project, it is important to consider how you will dispose of and archive your data. Check out these low-carbon website case studies. I want to create a digital edition of a book # Consider what would be the least energy intensive way to produce a digital edition of a book. Minimal Computing approaches can have advantages in terms of accessibility and longevity, as well as environmental impact. It is likely that you can publish a transcribed manuscript or a collection of images on a static website. For details on this, see Static versus Dynamic Websites. The Data Carbon Scorecard may help to facilitate discussions. Other considerations include: Images Hosting your digital edition with a green hosting provider. And even fonts I want to digitise a collection # Consider low carbon hosting, file formats, what resolution is necessary, whether 3D scans are really necessary, hardware longevity, digital access strategies to ensure the resource is used and to prevent unintentional redundancy, and processes for retiring data that is no longer needed. The Data Carbon Scorecard is a light touch tool to help you plan a new data project. The DIMPACT tool estimates emissions associated with audiovisual streaming and other digital activities. Currently most digitalisation guidelines don\u0026rsquo;t address environmental considerations. I want to create a personal website # First, consider the purpose of this website. Do you want to share blog posts, display images or include interactivity features such as comments? Use these questions to decide what kind of website is the most appropriate for your needs. For more details on this, see Static Versus Dynamic Websites. If you require a dynamic website, the section on Content Management Systems includes links to tools for creating more lightweight dynamic websites. The section on Tips for Sustainable Website Design includes a number of further useful tips, including advice on images, fonts, hosting considerations and more. Consider displaying a certification, e.g. Neuto\u0026rsquo;s Digital Carbon Rating Scale. I want to create a website for a research network # First, consider the purpose of this website. Do you want to share blog posts, display images or include interactivity features such as comments? Next you can decide what kind of website is the most appropriate for your needs. For more details on this, see Static Versus Dynamic Websites. If you require a dynamic website, the section on Content Management Systems includes links to tools for creating more lightweight dynamic websites. Additionally, the section on Tips for Sustainable Website Design includes useful information about images, fonts, hosting considerations and more. Lastly, you should consider how you will Archive Your Data. I want to train an AI # The section on Maximal Computing provides information on computationally intensive work. In particular, see discussion of Energy Proportionality, which will help you to consider your rationale for training an AI; and Measures of Efficiency, which provides information on using more energy efficient models. The section on Easy Wins contains advice on training models for machine learning tasks. Additionally, consider the carbon cost of AI in your project’s Data Management Plan. I want to build a piece of software # Check out the Software Development section, and the resources of the Green Software Foundation. Check out Green Coding Solutions\u0026rsquo; Green Metrics Tool, to measure the energy / CO2 consumption of software, especially containerized software. You might also be interested in Scaphandre, another open source tool for measuring energy / CO2 consumption of software. Read about Minimal Computing. Think about how your software will fit into the big picture of climate transition by checking out the toolkit\u0026rsquo;s Climate Change FAQs. I am writing a Data Management Plan # See section on Grant Writing and Data Management Plans for specific advice on energy proportionality, identifying relevant standards and frameworks, and more.\nI am an academic working with an external partner on their digital sustainability # Julie\u0026rsquo;s Bicycle has a lot of resources for arts and culture organisations. This briefing report focuses on digital sustainability. The Networked Condition has some interesting case studies and tools focused on artworks and the digital. Gallery Climate Coalition offers a carbon calculater for arts organisations. Check out the Case Studies section. Many different parts of the toolkit may be relevant, depending on your focus. It can be challenging for smaller organisations to find the resources to prioritise sustainability. Sometimes it may be helpful to focus on co-benefits (e.g. reducing electricity bills), while keeping in mind the big ethical and political questions - are there ways they can raise awareness through their programming or activities, use their experiences to advocate for better climate policies, and/or link their work to existing climate campaigns? I think my laptop / desktop / device needs replacing # Explore options for repair first. The section on Using Digital Devices in General in ‘Working Practices’ has useful information on the carbon cost of hardware and how to replace hardware in an environmentally responsible manner. This could also be an opportunity for Advocating within your Institution for more systemic change. You might see replacing your work computer in a sustainable way as a small change, but you can Connect Small Changes with Big Changes in order to improve institutional practices more generally. If you need to dispose of old equipment, consider organisations like the Turing Trust, Computers 4 Charity, Tameside Community Computers, Close the Gap, Little Lives, etc. I am requesting equipment for my DH lab # The section on Using Digital Devices in General in ‘Working Practices’ has useful information on the carbon cost of hardware and how to replace hardware in an environmentally responsible manner. Additionally, requesting lab equipment provides an opportunity for Advocating within your Institution. In particular, see sections on how to Get Involved in Supply Decisions and a list of Questions to ask senior decision-makers at your institution. I want to advocate for change within my institution # The section on Advocating within your Institution is definitely for you. Check out the 2024 Jisc report on Digital Sustainability in Tertiary Education. The Jisc roadmap suggests: cultivate responsible leadership, enable collaboration, empower action, teach with tech, and innovate (e.g. incorporate Jisc\u0026rsquo;s digital elevation tool and Honeywell Forge project). For several of these, the Teaching and Training section of the toolkit may be of use. Also check out the UKRI Net Zero Digital Research Infrastructure Scoping Project. Cloud Sustainability Watch has a checklist of actions that may inspire you. Explore whether the Green DISC certification might be right for your research group.

Minimal computing is a set of principles and practices that aim to reduce both environmental impact and barriers to access and engagement. It offers an important set of thinking tools to make responsible, frugal, and nuanced digital decisions.\nKey Recommendations Consider ways to reduce digital dependencies (software stacks), and in particular whether static websites and minimalist content management systems are appropriate for your project. When building and editing websites, use minimal web design principles and try to reduce client-side dynamic features Evaluate green web hosting options. Keep accessibility and inclusive design firmly in mind. What can researchers do to resist techno-utopian, carbon-intensive technological traps? How can we support environmentally responsible design—even if software filled with cool unnecessary features may forever tug on our heartstrings? Minimal computing (minicomp) has at least some of the answers.\nAs Jentery Sayers has written:\na minimal approach reduces the need for not only substantial storage and processing power but also a reliance on middleware, databases, peripherals, and substantial pieces of hardware. Such reduction should increase access while decreasing technology’s environmental effects (e.g., by reducing waste and energy consumption).\nThe label ‘low tech’ or ‘frugal’ does not mean unsophisticated—it means efficient and more accessible. By sharing content without bells and whistles (such as software dependencies that the content doesn’t really need), minimalist approaches offer a better chance that content will be accessible to most users. Low-tech solutions can significantly reduce data transfer in comparison to regular, database-driven websites. As Tim Frick has said, bad UX design is not just bad for users, it trashes the planet (see Frick’s book Designing for Sustainability, 2016).\nSince 2016, when the first Minimal Computing in DH workshop was held at the Digital Humanities ’16 conference, the constraints in which we conduct research have changed. There is now an urgent need to address the environmental consequences of digital technologies. This constraint has been growing for many decades, and is now a top priority out of necessity – we have procrastinated as a species and our paper was due yesterday!\nOur aim here is not to give black-and-white instructions. Oftentimes there is not one right answer for computing solutions. To be clear, minimal computing does not mean easy computing. All digital work entails labour, and in some cases minimal computing might entail more labour than standard computing, as Quinn Dombrowski recently argued in an essay in Digital Humanities Quarterly. However, the labour is worthwhile, because it will ensure a longer-lasting digital project that does not require more resources than are absolutely necessary. To gain a more accurate sense of the tradeoffs our technology choices have on our environments, we can leverage the minicomp (and environmental) principles to make informed decisions with proportional costs. (For more on the issue of computing and proportional costs, see also the section of this Toolkit on Maximal Computing)\nTerms that have some substantial overlaps with minimal computing include green software and digital sufficiency.\nTools and resources # Collectif Conception Numérique Responsable The Green Software Foundation The Green Web Foundation GO::DH Minicomp Working Group Google Scholar search for tools Minicomp Awesome List Open Sustainable Technologies Applying minimal computing principles # Sayers (2016) notes how a minimal approach can create complex questions and trade-offs. To work in minimal ways means “to define, often implicitly, what and for whom ‘excess’ and ‘essential’ mean in the first place.” For example, it may be important “to share the mess of development with others, and minimalist aesthetics may all too easily afford an impression that everything has been polished or refined from the start.”\nHere are some ways you might apply minimal computing principles in service of environmental sustainability:\nMinimal languages.\nUsing an efficient programming language can improve environmental impacts. If you have the liberty to make the language decision for yourself, there is some literature about the ecological impacts of these choices. How much energy, time and memory these languages require play an important role here. Humanities researchers often default to high level scripting languages, such as Python (perhaps they are easier for our humanist brains to understand). However, there are consequences for not thinking critically about our choice of programming languages.\nPython, the go-to language of choice for many Digital Humanities researchers, can be observed in the following table (Pereira et al. 2017) comparing the energy and time factors of Python. Note that ‘time’ in this context means compute time, which is the time the computer takes to run the scripts, and not the time it takes to learn to write the language (although learning time is an important cost of labour factor, it is not a direct environmental factor of computational research activity):\nEnergy Efficiency across Programming Languages (Pereira et. al. 2017).\nMinimal consumption.\nServerless instances which only consume compute time on demand. However, these require an understanding of the research and technical side to coordinate and operate. Shared libraries at the operating system levels, between the disk sharing and network sharing all add costs. The big providers use lots of memory, which is cheaper than hitting disk, but the consequence is you need big hardware and large scale data centres. Minimal maintenance.\nWhy are you still running it? On demand infrastructure: available upon user request, at specific times, and/or in specific contexts. This is a complex area subject to lots of options and discussion. Creating cost models Infrastructure is declared - a knowledge system to load the YAML file into to get your emissions costs back would be great - instead of the calculators. Get the ICT service catalogue to update with emissions/costs. Other principles. Here are some of the other principles to use to plan specific aspects of minimisation.\nMinimal design Minimal barriers Minimal internet Minimal externals Minimal automation Minimal space Minimal ephemerality Minimal visibility Maximum access Maximum accessibility Maximum impact Maximum mobility Maximising resources. For the full list of Minimal principles, see Jentery Sayers’s ‘Minimal Definitions’ (2016) at the Minimal Computing GO::DH site.\nStatic versus dynamic websites # As a society we need to start treating computational resources as finite and precious, to be utilised only when necessary, and as effectively as possible. We need frugal computing: achieving the same results for less energy.\nWim Vanderbauwhede\nA static website has fixed content which appears the same to every user (until it is manually updated). A dynamic website is generated “on the fly” and is more associated with interactivity. Social media sites are dynamic websites, since they are woven together from a variety of user generated content.\nFigure: a dizzying diagram of dynamic websites (Image: Partricia Searl, University of Virginia Press.)\nA dynamic site uses server-side programming languages and technologies to pull information from a database and show it on your browser. All project data and content is stored in a content management system (CMS), which allows for bespoke, personalised, and automated changes to websites. Dynamic sites tend to be content-heavy and user-driven (that is to say the users are interacting with the content in specific ways). A static site consists of a directory of files that lives on the server. This means that when you are accessing web content, you are directly accessing a file on the server rather than making a request to a database or CMS for the content. Pages are therefore accessed as-is and changes need to be made file-by-file. A hybrid web site uses both elements of dynamic and static content. Why might you choose one or the other (or both)?\nThere are good reasons to create dynamic websites, but a lot of scholarly projects will do just fine with static sites. Most of us are simply trying to communicate information on our websites: blogs, portfolios, project websites, magazines, documentation sites all can be made cheaply and hassle-free with static site generators. For example, if you are putting your CV online, you do not need a WordPress site to do that well. Static site generators, such as Hugo, even have excellent themes (e.g. Academic) for creating content such as CVs. If you have a collection of transcribed manuscripts, you can also publish that as a static site. Dynamic sites work better and are more appropriate for more complex projects that have interactive features like APIs, search engines, data visualisations, and other structured information stored in databases. That said, even a hybrid site that mixes some dynamic and static content will reduce its carbon impact. Wholegrain Digital offer a well-documented tool for estimating the carbon footprint of a website.\nAlthough, it’s a little more complicated.\nThe benefit from a static site is a little more blurred nowadays, because of the way data gets cached on the web. Browsers store certain data to speed up repeat visits and may send the website an ETag to quickly check if a piece of content has changed. If not, it uses its cached copy. Service providers have similar caching techniques. This means it is not always clear which parts of your backend infrastructure are being hit directly when you use a dynamic site. A good proportion of the content might actually already be stored on your device.\nSee this case study from Green Coding Berlin, which asks, \u0026ldquo;How much do we save when moving our site from Wordpress to HUGO by looking at the per-request energy but also at the build time?\u0026rdquo;\nStatic Site Generators # Use a static site where possible. You can do so using a static site generator such as:\nJekyll, which has a longer history but also has more dependencies (it relies on Ruby on Rails). Hugo, which runs on the Go programming language, has fewer dependencies and attractive templates (this tool-kit runs on Hugo, by the way). Gatsby, which is good for single-page layouts, landing pages, web applications, portfolios, and institutional websites. And there are many more Awesome Static Web Site Generators. The \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; static site tool will depend on your own skills and needs - this is a useful introduction to thinking these through. See also Fast Familiar\u0026rsquo;s Climate Action Site Builder. Content Management Systems # However, static sites will never be suitable for everything. A content management system (CMS) is a tool that helps you create a dynamic website without coding. WordPress and Drupal are well-known examples, but there are lightweight alternatives you can use instead:\nStrapi: An open-source modern headless CMS alternative to WordPress. Ghost: A lightweight headless CMS designed for content creators. Mukurtu: A grassroots CMS project aiming to empower communities to manage, share, narrate, and exchange their digital heritage in culturally relevant and ethically-minded ways. If you are accustomed to building websites with online CMS platforms like SquareSpace, Wix, or Wordpress, there may be a bit of a learning curve. But it is probably not as steep as it looks, and well worth investing the time. Wagtail is also worth investigating.\nTips for sustainable websites # Minimal web design for beginners\nUse fewer videos and images. Make the ones you do use really count! Turn off autoplay for videos, and use lazy loading so that images are only loaded if needed. Shrink your images using a tool like Squoosh. Use the newer WebP image format (but keep your eye on browser compatibility). Try out vector graphics such as SVG files. Create an attractive, accessible design that favours dark colours. On some screen types they use less energy. Do some research and try to pick a green hosting provider. The Green Web Foundation’s directory is one useful resource. Use a tools such as Ecograder and Webvert (in French), to see the carbon impact of your site, and learn more about unnecessary elements (e.g. unused Javascript). If your site is large and/or complex, a search function may help to eliminate unnecessary browsing around. Avoid use of large third-party scripts, such as social media plug-ins or \u0026ldquo;all-in-one\u0026rdquo; solutions. Images and Lazy Loading # According to HTTP Archive, images constitute 50% of the average web page size. WebP instead of JPEG or PNG can reduce file size by 25-35% while increasing page speed performance. Switching icons and logos to SVG format can also significantly reduce page weight. If possible, consider whether you need an image in your design first and foremost. If so, ask how important the quality of the image needs to be (eg is it an important figure, or purely for background/decoration) and adjust the file format and quality accordingly.\nEnabling lazy loading will optimise image and video content. Instead of loading all of the page’s resources simultaneously, the browser only loads what’s above the fold and then fetches additional images and thumbnails as the user scrolls.\nResponsive images can also be really useful in making sure that only the minimal image size needed is served to a user. This approach involves generating each image in several sizes, and letting the user\u0026rsquo;s browser select the one which is most appropriate for their screen size, resolution, and DPI. This means that a user on a large Apple monitor may receive a large, clear image file, but that a user on a small phone will receive an image a fraction of the size.\nAs image creation usually requires multiple sizes and formats to be created, this is often an automated process. Check the documentation or support for your server setup to see if this can be enabled. For instance, WordPress has multiple plugins that can do this, alongside other optimisations (sadly, a full comparison is outside the scope of this toolkit).\nResponsive image markup # Responsive image markup involves using the srcset and sizes attributes in the tag, to give the browser multiple image sources, plus guidance about which to choose based on the current screen size.\nsrcset: This attribute allows you to specify a list of image source files along with their widths. The browser will then choose the most appropriate image based on the screen resolution and the sizes attribute. sizes: This attribute tells the browser how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. Essentially, it\u0026rsquo;s a way to inform the browser about the size of the image as it will be displayed on the page, which helps the browser select the most appropriately sized image from the srcset, e.g. \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;default.jpg\u0026#34; srcset=\u0026#34;small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 1500w\u0026#34; sizes=\u0026#34;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Descriptive text\u0026#34;\u0026gt; In this example, 500w, 1000w, and 1500w indicate the width of each image file. The \u0026lsquo;sizes\u0026rsquo; attribute tells the browser to use the full viewport width (100vw) for devices with a width of 600 pixels or less, and half the viewport width (50vw) for devices wider than 600 pixels.\nAlternatively, an image resizing API might let you store just one image that gets adjusted as appropriate.\nOverall visual style # Reduce or eliminate videos and animation. Use fewer images and make sure you compress them. Try using fewer photographs overall. When you do use photographs, you may want to experiment with visual styles that result in smaller file sizes. For example, you could explore using shallow depth of field, and/or restricted colour palettes. Treat it as a fun challenge: use the lightweightness constraints to inspire you to create visually delicious web sites.\nMinify HTML, CSS and scripts # ‘Minifying’ is a process of removing unnecessary whitespace and line breaks in HTML, CSS and javascripts with the goal of reducing the file sizes to increase page load speeds. Many text editors have plug-ins or packages to minify code (see e.g. Sublime text minify and Atom minify). If you’re using XSLT, then use the normalize-space() function. E.g.\n\u0026lt;xsl:template match=\u0026#34;text()\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsl:value-of select=\u0026#34;normalize-space(.)\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsl:template\u0026gt; Reduce client-side features (i.e. JavaScript) # Web pages need to load, and they can be loaded just once, but when you implement user interaction features, JavaScript continuously runs in the background. For example, it’s now very common for sites to have parallax scrolling that redraws the screen when you scroll down the page, but this means that the web page must continuously consume energy on the device.\nOther JavaScript features which are often requested are things like comments/forums (e.g. Discuss.io) or Web accessibility compliance tools (e.g. Recite me). These can be very useful in the right circumstances, but a minicomp assessment is rarely understood by the executive managers who make the final decisions to purchase such digital services. This maximisation of the technology supply chain through outsourcing is a shape of digital architecture which often results in you paying a company to take a copy of your user\u0026rsquo;s data so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to pay attention to managing that data yourself - and some would not consider this a fair or minimal technical solution.\nBeyond potential structural unfairness introduced by the use of outsourced client-side features, there can be further, more subtle effects on the Organisation. In the specific case of ReCite Me, which is a tool to create inclusive accessible websites, its use affords the organisation to believe that the digital content they create and publish online is always inclusive and conforms to the web accessibility standards - when a more minicomp approach might be to spend the time teaching your workforce how to communicate inclusively and how to publish accessible websites to begin with.\nA significant proportion of scripts are from third-party advertising or social media services, and from \u0026ldquo;all-in-one\u0026rdquo; packages for creating websites. If integrating third-party tools (such as software and plug-ins for building your website, or for sharing your site on social media), consider whether you really need them, and review the size of the files they add carefully.\nLoad only what you need # Code libraries (like jQuery) and frameworks (like Bootstrap) are collections of pre-written code that developers use to save time. They provide ready-made functions and design patterns for common tasks, such as manipulating webpage elements or creating responsive layouts. Libraries and frameworks often come with extensive features, covering needs for a wide range of applications. However, a single web site might only use a small fraction of these available features. The rest of the code, though not used, still gets loaded, adding to the page\u0026rsquo;s weight. So:\nMany libraries and frameworks allow for custom builds where you only select and include the components you need. Opt for modular libraries that let you import only the parts you need. This can significantly reduce the amount of unused code. Review your website’s dependencies from time to time. Remove any libraries or parts of libraries that you no longer use. Try the latest plain vanilla CSS / JavaScript. Some functionalities that once required external libraries can now be achieved with plain CSS and JavaScript. Benchmark with CO2.js and other tools # CO2.js is a JavaScript library to help web developers and software engineers to estimate their emissions. You can run it in the browser, or in Node.js server environments, or in certain serverless and edge compute runtimes. It can be used within the development process, and/or to integrate carbon impact estimates into the user experience.\nQuickstart guide CO2.js GitHub repo Curious about driving the transition to a fossil-free internet? Here’s how CO2.js can help (February 2023) CO2.js currently uses two models to estimate carbon emissions: the Sustainable Web Design model, and the OneByte model. The \u0026ldquo;perByte\u0026rdquo; carbon estimates from the OneByte model are lower than those from Sustainable Web Design (given the same amount of data transferred).\nOf course, CO2.js needs assumptions about carbon intensity. (Is the data floating to its destination on the wind, waves, or sunbeams? Or is it being propelled there by blazing oil and coal!) Currently CO2.js draws country-scale grid intensity data from Ember, enriched with marginal intensity data from the UNFCCC.\nWholegrain Digital\u0026rsquo;s Website Carbon Calculator also offer a tool for estimating the carbon footprint of a website. Most browsers also come with built-in page inspector tools, which in some cases may let you analyse CPU useage and other useful metrics.\nConsider mobile-first design # Many users throughout the world access internet content through mobile phones on slower, less reliable connections, so a mobile-friendly design ensures better accessibility as well as a lightweight design. Loading an image or watching a video on a phone uses less energy than on a great big screen.\nIn general, this means taking everything in this page together, and conducting testing on at least a handful of devices (such as a phone and a tablet) to check how they respond. Simpler, less detailed designs can improve accessibility and navigation, which in turn can lead to fewer page loads and less data usage all round.\nFonts # Your site’s font can actually have a carbon impact and affect accessibility. For example, lightweight sans serif fonts such as Trebuchet are not only good for people with disabilities but they have less ‘weight’ (fewer tails and flourishes) and therefore require fewer pixels to be displayed. Verdana is also good because it is set wider than most fonts (making it more legible without adding weight). Use one of 18 web-safe fonts to make the content compatible with all browsers and screen readers.\nIf using custom fonts, careful optimisation can reduce the size of a single font from 250kb+ to just 10kb. Like images, the choice of the font\u0026rsquo;s file format is important. Wholegrain\u0026rsquo;s guide to font sizes is a good introduction to this, but in general use the WOFF2 format where you can. Secondly, you can choose to use just a subset of the font\u0026rsquo;s characters to reduce the file size further. For instance, Everything Fonts has a Font Subsetter tool.\nHosting # The Green Web Foundation has a hosting directory of hundreds of green hosting providers across dozens of countries. In the UK, Kualo is a very good option.\nAnother option could be to host your static site on a platform like GitHub Pages, just as we do with this website.\nIn general, whether a host or server is \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo; or not is a complex, and rapidly-evolving topic - carbon offsets and renewable energy certificate schemes tend to make the underlying definition fairly complicated. At a higher level, you can generalise to a particular country or region based on its overall energy mix - Norway, Sweden and Europe are broadly more \u0026lsquo;green\u0026rsquo; than other countries (although this needs to be balanced with data privacy between countries, if personal data is being used).\nCaching # Server setup and configuration is a large and complex topic and will depend on what software you\u0026rsquo;re running, but there are some simple steps you can take to reduce data usage. Primarily, aim to make sure that browsers are able to cache any static content provided, for a decent amount of time (such as a year). This avoids the same data having to be sent repeatedly during a single visit to the site, or on short-term return visits.\nClient-side caching occurs on the user\u0026rsquo;s browser. When a user visits a website, resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript files are stored (cached) on their device. If the user returns, the browser can load these resources from the local cache instead of fetching them from the server again. Implementing caching effectively involves identifying static content that doesn\u0026rsquo;t change often, such as images and CSS files, which can be stored in the browser cache or on a content delivery network (CDN). If you\u0026rsquo;re using a CDN provider, that\u0026rsquo;s another opportunity to ask a supplier about their sustainability (and constructively scrutinise their claims).\nDynamic content and API call results can also be cached by employing strategies like cache busting, where a version number or timestamp is appended to filenames to manage updates. By reducing the amount of data transmitted over the network and decreasing server processing requirements, caching can lower its energy consumption. Generally speaking, static content can be cached for longer periods, whereas dynamic content may require shorter cache durations. Using HTTP headers like Cache-Control helps control how long content is stored in browser caches.\nServer-side caching is about storing a copy of the content generated by the server, such as web pages, images, or other data, so that the server doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to regenerate it from scratch every time a user requests it. This cached content is stored in a temporary location on the server or an intermediate cache server like Varnish Cache. When a page is requested for the first time, the server processes the request, fetches data from a database if needed, generates the HTML for the page, and serves it to the user\u0026rsquo;s browser. With server-side caching, this generated page gets cached for the next user.\nBlocking bots # If you find you are popular with our automated friends, consider using a script to discourage them.\nSoftware development # It is worth exploring the work of the Green Software Foundation, including the Software Carbon Intensity Specification, which includes a methodology for calculating a SCI score for \u0026ldquo;any software application, from a large, distributed cloud system to a small monolithic open source library, any on-premise application, or even a serverless function\u0026rdquo; (Green Software Foundation 2021). See also the Impact Framework, which helps to calculate carbon impacts of applications through writing a relatively simple manifest file:\nAn Impact Framework manifest file is powerful because anyone can re-execute it and verify an organization\u0026rsquo;s impact calculation. You can even experiment by swapping out different plugins. The critical concept is that everything you need to calculate an impact is provided in the manifest file and anyone can re-run a calculation with the manifest file and the lightweight Impact Framework command line tool. (Design philosophy)\nYou may also want to investigate the efficiencies of different coding languages. Could this be something you develop in a relatively energy-efficient language like C, C++, or Rust? Mojo is a newer programming language that may be worth investigating too; it promises, \u0026ldquo;Write Python or scale all the way down to the metal.\u0026rdquo;\nCritical design and system change # ‘Digital technology has ushered in an age of inconspicuous consumption. It is easy to understand the environmental impact of buying \u0026lsquo;stuff\u0026rsquo; or flying across the Atlantic. It is harder to wrap your head around how much energy it takes to fly data across the web.’\nArwa Mahdawi, The Guardian\nMinimal computing can sometimes feel like fighting a losing battle. Joana Moll’s project The Hidden Life of an Amazon User seeks to make visible the huge amount of code involved in making one simple purchase from Amazon:\nIn order to purchase the book, the Amazon website forces the customer to go through twelve different interfaces composed of large amounts of code, which is normally invisible to the average user. This code carries out all sorts of operations, such as organizing and styling the site’s content, allowing interactivity, and recording the user’s activity. Overall, I was able to track 1,307 different requests to all sort of scripts and documents, totaling 8,724 A4 pages worth of printed code, adding up to 87.33MB of information. The amount of energy needed to load each of the twelve web interfaces, along with each one’s endless fragments of code, was approximately 30 wh. (Moll 2019)\nDo we really have to burn coal so that every user can get personalised recommendations whether they want them or not? Yet these maximalist approaches are everywhere. So how do we also work toward larger structural change? We need to do two things:\nAdopt and promote behaviour change (such as minimal computing), and advocate for deeper structural changes to support those changes in the longer term. Although the first point is vital, on its own it is not enough. E.g. a review of interventions at the household level concludes that: “taken in isolation, behavioural interventions have a very small positive effect on climate change mitigation behaviours while the intervention is in place. Once the intervention stops, there is no evidence that such interventions produce lasting positive changes” (Nisa et al., 2019). Rather, lasting positive changes come when there are structures that support and encourage them.\nThe design of technological interfaces and systems, where the human meets the machine, are among the structures that must change. So are cultural norms, the rules and norms of communities and organisations, and legal and economic structures. So we might think of the link between Minimal computing and system change as a series of opportunities:\nWhen a user behaviour is wasteful, there is an opportunity to transform that behaviour. When a user behaviour resists transformation, there is an opportunity to redesign the technical environment. When a technical environment resists transformation, it is an opportunity to redesign the institutional environment. Whenever the institutional environment resists transformation, it is an opportunity to push for deeper legal and economic changes. In this way, the everyday use of digital systems (for research and other purposes) reveals an abundance of research questions, data gaps, design challenges, exercises you might set your students, opportunities for technological innovation or entrepreneurship, as well as ways to focus and refine advocacy and activism for deeper system change. See “Advocating Within Your Institution” for further ideas.\nCase studies # The Endings Project: This project offers tools, principles, policies and recommendations for digital scholarship practitioners to create accessible, stable, long-lasting resources in the humanities. Low-tech Magazine: This magazine runs a static website on a solar panel.

When you do need to use maximal computing, consider using less-intensive processes like using smaller models and adapting existing infrastructures. Understand how to use efficiency metrics like T-scores, confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, Area under the ROC curve, LOGLOSS. Consider doing an Algorithmic Impact Assessment before developing or making substantial use of an AI tool. Engage critically with Big Tech, and examine the sustainability implications of mainstreaming deep learning AI in the future. Problems of Proportionality # How do we apply digital sufficiency, or digital sobriety, in an era of intense commercial and geopolitical competition around AI? Maximal computing systems are everywhere these days. For example, AI is used in content generation, search, speech recognition, translation, computer vision, and many other areas. In many parts of the world, AI is present within our homes, cars, mobile phones. New applications of AI are being implemented with the help of large publicly open datasets, available on the web (for example open crawl), which in turn are fed to models trained with huge hardware capabilities (training on GPUs and TPUs). Such maximal computing may help with adaptation to climate change; Gordon S. Blair gives the example of flooding resilience:\nThe challenges facing flood risk management practitioners are considerable as they make long-term decisions, e.g., about investments in flood defenses, with limited budgets. [...] Thanks to developments in digital technology, though, major changes are now anticipated, in particular related to the plethora of data becoming available (cf. big data)\u0026mdash;from satellite imagery, from sensors deployed around catchments (cf. the Internet of Things), from detailed studies carried out by local authorities, from citizen science, and from mining data from the web.\nBlair, 2020\nMaximal computing is an important part of STEM research, but it is also growing within the arts and humanities (e.g. interest in generative models such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion). While it is well-recognised that global heating results from carbon and other greenhouse gases, broader AI communities have been slow to understand the relevance of our activities. As Knowles et. al (2021) note:\nA serious and proportional response to the climate emergency would [...] involve constraining energy demand and mitigating drivers of infrastructure growth, and as a result, also consuming less energy. In real terms for computing, this means manufacturing fewer devices, storing and processing less data, generally managing with less compute power; and in terms of technical ambitions, scaling back the Internet of Things, resisting the temptation to throw AI and blockchain at every problem, and breaking free of the cycle of ever increasing demand for computation.\nKnowles et al., 2021\nMaximal computing processes also often take place in the cloud, which means the carbon costs may also been less visible (see Question the Cloud section). So how do we decide whether a computational process is proportionate to the benefits it may create? In other words, when does it become appropriate to \u0026rsquo;throw AI and blockchain\u0026rsquo; at a problem? Can the underlying goals of computationally intensive work sometimes be met in different ways? And when we do decide to use computationally intensive processes, how can we optimise them from a climate and sustainability perspective?\nCompute needed to train state-of-the-art models have risen exponentially since about 2012 (Source: OpenAI, https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/.)\nSome easy wins # Don\u0026rsquo;t use AI at all. What are you trying to achieve? Can it be accomplished in another way? Don\u0026rsquo;t use AI just for fun. Have fun of course, but also have a purpose in mind, one which would be sufficient even if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t fun. Use pre-trained models. There are so many to choose from! Share your models. If you do train a model, try to make it available for others to use. Support initiatives that help us to clearly document and to openly share the fruits of the carbon we have burned. Use smaller models. Larger models may yield better results, but often a smaller one will still do everything you need. You might also want to consider how you are framing \u0026lsquo;better\u0026rsquo; results. For example, explore ChatGPT alternatives. Minimise use of multi-modal models. Prefer task-specific models over multi-purpose models to reduce energy consumption. Luccioni et al. (2023) write, \u0026ldquo;This is especially the case for text classification (on IMDB, SST 2 and Rotten Tomatoes) and question answering (on SciQ, SQuAD v1 and v2), where the gap between task-specific and zero-shot models is particularly large, and less so for summarization (for CNN-Daily Mail, SamSUM and XSum).\u0026rdquo; Minimise use of decoder-only models. There is some evidence suggesting seq2seq models are slightly less energy intensive. Try not to overtrain your model. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to keep teaching the model something it learned 50 steps ago. Explore scheduling, carbon-aware computing, and grid-aware computing. It may be possible to train your model when renewable energy is more plentiful. Weigh up the pros and cons of doing it in the Cloud vs. on-prem. Generally speaking, hyperscale datacentres can take advantage of economies of scale and access renewable energy more cheaply. However, if your institution has High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities that you can access, there may be greater opportunities for collaboration and optimisation, compared to renting your compute off Amazon, Google or Microsoft. Shao et al. (2022) review some metrics for data centre energy efficiency. Support responsible use with UX design. If you are building something, that may mean making it deliberately less fascinating and immersive. In this space, user engagement in itself is not a measure of success. For more information on minimal UX design, see the \u0026ldquo;Minimal Computing\u0026rdquo; section of this Toolkit. Raise awareness of the issue. Normalise responsible use of compute, hold big AI companies accountable, and advocate for better regulation of AI. Then it gets complicated # Consider Model Architecture Efficiency: Explore sequence-to-sequence models instead of decoder-only models for similar tasks, as they tend to be slightly less energy- and carbon-intensive.\n1. Can it be deferred?: Does this computational process really have to be done now? Could it be done in five years\u0026rsquo; time, when (if all goes according to plan) much more energy will be generated from renewable sources? Of course, research is often about winning the race, but maybe that\u0026rsquo;s an attitude that needs to shift.\n2. What is its carbon impact? Monitoring maximal computing may help to identify where use is suboptimal or disproportionate to what the job is trying to achieve. How does your institution monitor IT energy use, whether on-prem or in the public cloud? What kind of data is collected, and who gets to see it? Maximal computing resources are often denominated in hours of core use. Can it instead be denominated in CO2e?\nThe AI Energy Score Leaderboard may help you make decisions, although at the time of writing it doesn\u0026rsquo;t include many of the major AI models out there, because of a lack of data.\nThere are often sustainability benefits from outsourcing to the hyperscale data centres of the cloud giants (e.g. Amazon, Google, Microsoft), but a loss of transparency.\nCan you make sure your computation is done in a relatively green data centre?\nSee also the open source Cloud Carbon Footprint tool and associated resources.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a good rule of thumb to switch to the most environmentally sustainable data centres you can. Of course, this is a complicated issue: as with any finite resource, when you use this clean energy, you may be preventing someone else from using it. The standard, upbeat answer is that switching to green data centres stimulates demand for more green data centres and more green energy to power and cool them. Yet the relationship between demand for green cloud services and global GHG emissions is far from straightforward. Green data centres don\u0026rsquo;t pop up overnight in response to extra demand. Then there is the fact that the actual carbon intensity of a given datacentre can vary significantly based on time of day and the season of the year. Jevons\u0026rsquo; paradox might also be applicable: when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, the rate of consumption of that resource sometimes increases, rather than decreasing. More broadly, degrowth and postgrowth may prove useful analytic lenses.\n3. On what balance sheet(s) will the carbon impact appear? Will it be your own university or research institution (Scope 2), or some third party (Scope 3)? Are you happy with the way the reporting entity measures and discloses its carbon impact?\n4. What are the potential benefits? Clearly, the underlying purpose of a project has bearing on how we assess its proportionality.\n5. Do these benefits relate to sustainability? If so, you might decide to be a bit more lenient. Is your goal to optimize planting patterns for beleaguered pollinators, or to call out greenwashing in corporate disclosures at scale, or to tailor communications relating to famine relief? Or will the outcomes be unrelated to sustainability, or even maladaptive?\n6. What are the broader ethical questions? Perhaps (as occasionally seems to happen sometimes in AI research) your goals are pure evil, only you haven\u0026rsquo;t noticed yet? Bringing in ethical considerations in an intensive way, early in the process, may help to decide when maximal approaches are appropriate. The ethics of AI is a very rich field. Prominent themes include bias (e.g. gender, race, language, class, geography, disability), opacity (is AI explainable? If so, who explains and who listens?), and broader considerations of justice. AlgorithmWatche\u0026rsquo;s SustAIn series connects AI ethics and AI sustainability. The Critical Algorithm Studies reading list and Zotero Library contain further reading on the politics and ethics of AI and algorithms more broadly. The Data Hazards project is developing labels that seek to communicate the risks involved in Data Science approaches, from concerns about privacy to high environmental cost: \u0026lsquo;Considering worst case scenarios is one part of this puzzle. Worst case scenarios free us from trying to predict the future: we\u0026rsquo;re not saying that something will happen\u0026rsquo; (Thurlby, Natalie and Di Cara, Nina 2021).\n7. How likely is it to succeed? This is a question you can ask at multiple scales, e.g. a project, a model, a query.\n8. Is there still optimization that could be done?: How lean was the software building process / is the software? Are there ways to improve or to green it (i.e. reduce resource consumption)? Can computationally intensive jobs be scheduled for when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing?\nFocusing on Natural Language Processing, Strubell et al. (2019) recommend \u0026ldquo;a concerted effort by industry and academia to promote research of more computationally efficient algorithms, as well as hardware that requires less energy\u0026rdquo; as well as the development and promotion of \u0026ldquo;easy-to-use APIs implementing more efficient alternatives to brute-force grid search for hyperparameter tuning, e.g. random or Bayesian hyperparameter search techniques\u0026rdquo; (Strubell, Ganesh, and McCallum 2019)\nCodeCarbon can be embedded in Python code, to estimate emissions based on location, and recommend compute regions with lower carbon intensity for major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and Google).\nXu et al. (2021) offer a survey of deep learning optimisation techniques, which they categorise into compact networks, energy-efficient training strategies, energy-efficient inference approaches, and energy-efficient data usage.\n9. What about openness? Are you using maximal computing in ways that can benefit other researchers and creators?\nPerhaps it's time for some new types of open licenses, that aim to influence the carbon impact of derivative software and applications? We are of course deeply in favour of open practice. Nonetheless, even here there may be negative considerations too. In some cases a project may be justified by its proportionate use of maximal computing, yet if shared inappropriately, will predictably result in unjustifiable variants. Also check out the Foundation Model Transparency Index project.\n10. What affordances are you creating?: If you are building something, does it encourage or enforce responsible use? Does your choice architecture and UI seek to maximise user engagement, or does it seek to encourage users to be careful and reflective?\nThere is not yet any standard or certification for responsible UX design for computationally intensive software. Maybe you could be the person to develop one? Responsible AI Governance # There is a rapidly evolving landscape of frameworks, tools, and platforms for developing and deploying AI responsibly. Most of these have yet to credibly integrate climate and environmental considerations. For example, at present, some Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIAs) tools encourage assessment of the impacts of automated decision-making on ecosystems, while leaving out the environmental costs of developing and deploying the AI models themselves (or vice-versa); other tools invite reflection on those costs, without offering guidance on how to estimate or measuring these costs.\nOECD catalogue AI Standards Hub Measures of Efficiency # Machine Learning models are can be measured using metrics like T-scores, confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, Area under the ROC curve, LOGLOSS (Minaee 2019). It is becoming more common to see the literature report on the electricity and environmental consumption required for advanced maximal computational research. Some useful environmentally relevant metrics to consider when planning your AI research projects are:\nFloating point operations (FPO), in FLOPS, GigaFlops Processor utilisation (%), % use of CPU/GPU/TPU Electricity consumption, in Watt Hours (Wh) Lacoste et al. have been researching environmental impacts of AI, and have developed an online open source Machine Learning CO2 impact calculator. Lannelongue et al.\u0026rsquo;s Green Algorithms tool is another useful flexible tool for estimating carbon impacts, with a useful discussion. See also Dodge et al. (2022), \u0026lsquo;Measuring the Carbon Intensity of AI in Cloud Instances\u0026rsquo; and Verdecchia et al. (2023), \u0026lsquo;A Systematic Review of Green AI\u0026rsquo;.\nRed AI and Green AI # \u0026ldquo;The vital first step toward more equitable and green AI is the clear and transparent reporting of electricity consumption, carbon emissions, and cost. You can\u0026rsquo;t improve what you can\u0026rsquo;t measure.\u0026rdquo; Jesse Dodge, Allen Institute for AI, coauthor of Green AI.\nIn 2020, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) suggested that to measure efficiency of AI models we need to report on the amount of work required. This includes the work to train the model, tune the hyperparameters and retrain the model repeatedly in however many iterations you use. Understanding the costs for a single document, the size of the data set and the steps in your pipeline (such as preprocessing, cleaning, and enriching) helps you to comprehend the total work required, and thus allows you to optimise at specific points in your pipeline. Red AI refers to the dominant approach, that seeks to improve results through massive computational power without regard to environmental impact. Striving to \u0026ldquo;treat efficiency as a primary evaluation criterion alongside accuracy\u0026rdquo; is what Schwartz et al. call Green AI.\nContrasting with much of the evidence assembled here, this 2022 preprint offers an optimistic assessment of future model training carbon impacts, and proposes some best practices (selecting sparser models, using optimised processors such as TPUs and recent GPUs, using hyperscalers rather than on-prem data centres, and choosing data centres powered by the cleanest energy).\nUnderstanding Cloud emissions # It also makes a big difference where (and when) you train and deploy your model. Climatiq offers a series of introductory articles to Cloud emissions:\nMeasuring greenhouse gas emissions in data centres The role of Amazon Web Services, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform Approaches to assessing emissions Approaches to reducing Cloud emissions Datacentre sustainability is strongly influenced by location, and the local availability of green electricity. Electricity Maps is an open source visualization project to help understand the climate impacts of energy use.\nThe Science Based Targets initiative sectoral guidance for ICT includes a focus on datacentres. To get a rough understanding of where the Cloud\u0026rsquo;s emissions fit into ICT emissions as a whole, the order goes (from largest impact to smallest): manufacturing user devices, running user devices, running data networks, running data centres, manufacturing data networks, manufacturing data centres. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t include crypto though. (We\u0026rsquo;d like to include some more granular recent data here, if you have any to add).\nThe environmental pledges and policies of the cloud giants (Microsoft, Amazon, and Google/Alphabet) deserve scrutiny. At the time of writing, the differences between them are significant, but none deserves enthusiastic praise.\nAmazon Employees 4 Climate Justice Clouded: Uncovering the Culture of the Cloud and film (2022) Clouded II (2024) Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (2023) Carbon Market Watch \u0026lsquo;Clouds of Carbon\u0026rsquo; in Jisc, Exploring Digital Footprints (2022) News article focusing on Latin America GEC\u0026rsquo;s guide for procurers of cloud services (2019) Learning about Cloud emissions will quite quickly take you into the realm of energy generation and the power grid. For example, the 24/7 carbon-free energy approach, supported by a UN compact, appears to be a big improvement on previous highly financialised \u0026lsquo;annual matching\u0026rsquo; approaches. The grid-aware computing approach also seems to improve substantially on carbon-aware computing.\nFinOps and GreenOps # Within business, there is already a considerable body of theory and practice around cloud optimisation, associated with the FinOps approach. FinOps actions taken to reduce cloud spend (e.g. reservation management, data lifecycle management, continuous rightsizing) often have the unintended consequence of reducing carbon emissions too (although that\u0026rsquo;s not always the case).\nInterestingly, FinOps is also not just about cost in a narrow sense, but about multidimensional value (for example, the \u0026ldquo;Iron Triangle\u0026rdquo; of fast, cheap, and good service). FinOps practitioners are interested in the various trade-offs and co-benefits of using the Cloud in different ways.\nThis means there is good potential to integrate sustainability (and even climate justice) into FinOps practice. By bringing together financial, IT, and sustainability teams under a common objective, a FinOps Centre of Sustainable Excellence, or a GreenOps Centre of Excellence, might allow these traditionally siloed disciplines to collaborate and share expertise.\nHowever, the GreenOps approach is still emerging. Sustainability is not yet a prominent theme in FinOps literature. As you might expect, FinOps also leans techno-solutionist, so there is potential for tensions with perspectives such as digital sobriety, Minimal Computing, or degrowth.\nMajor cloud providers offer tools that anticipate a FinOps perspective, including AWS Trusted Advisor, Microsoft Azure Cost Management, GCP Cost Management.\nOther terms include DevGreenOps (Greenspector) and DevSustainOps (Eric Zie, Decarbonise the Digital).\nFurther reading:\nFilippo Vanara, IDC, \u0026lsquo;Rise of FinOps and GreenOps \u0026ndash; The Importance of These Strategies in 2023 and Beyond\u0026rsquo; (2023).

Putting a Sustainable Focus on FinOps (2023) Quantum computing # This isn\u0026rsquo;t something we have looked into yet, but we would appreciate any evidence or resources. A cursory exploration of the intersection of quantum computing and climate suggests quite a lot of positive framings, although also quite clearly some significant hype. Here\u0026rsquo;s one interesting extended blog post:\nPinto, Karan, \u0026lsquo;Quantum Tech for Better Climate: A Thesis\u0026rsquo;, Entangle Quantum (2022)\nMini case study # GPT-n workshops case study # Jo Lindsay Walton\nIn some recent workshops to introduce participants to GPT-n text generators, participants fine-tuned a pre-trained model using texts of their choosing.\nThere were good pedagogic reasons to let everyone choose their own input text, e.g. from Gutenberg, for the fine tuning: it turns the activity into a more exciting experiment. It also made sense for me to do the activity myself, because (1) it's easy to forget details when you're describing something from memory and notes, and (2) I know from experience that certain fine-tuning texts will \u0026quot;work well,\u0026quot; so we would have at least one interesting output to discuss at the end.\nBut in the short time available, participants often chose arbitrary and / or \u0026quot;obvious\u0026quot; input texts (e.g. Shakespeare, or an author they were primed to choose because they had been mentioned earlier in the workshop). Likewise, pushed for prep time, the workshop leader realised they were tending to use the same input texts again and again. Furthermore, we would generate hundreds of pages of text, and then only browse the first few - and never use the rest for anything.\nMy new rule of thumb: if I am running a computationally intensive process for educational or demo purposes, do so in a way that doubles as research (in a loose sense of \u0026quot;research\u0026quot;).\nFor the latest iteration of the workshop we have:\nExplicitly included discussion of carbon costs. Used a recording of myself doing the fine-tuning and text generation. Created a shared folder of potential fine-tuning inputs which I am interested in for various reasons - participants could choose one of these or pick their own. Built in time to discuss actual immediate use cases of text generation, and what questions we might ask of the output (and how many pages we needed to generate). In some ways the workshop felt clunkier, and I had to cut some content which I liked. But it still felt worth it to include very basic sustainability considerations.\nIf I run similar workshops in the future I hope to:\nFind out more about the actual carbon footprint of these processes. Explore a format where small groups collaborate, running just one fine-tuning per group. Explore choosing from a variety of already fine-tuned models, rather than running new fine-tunings. Seek out others who may already want synthetic texts based on specific fine-tuning inputs, and offer to do this for them as part of the workshop. Continue to think about proportionality, and if the carbon cost does seem too high, then replace the workshop with something else entirely. I don't think that the energy savings will be extensive. When I think of all the users of art AIs, generating thousands and thousands of images just out of curiosity or a playful compulsion, it feels like a drop in the ocean. But it also feels important to model responsible behaviour. A minimal set of principles for using AI to generate text or art might involve:\nSpend the time to articulate what I am trying to do and why (not just \u0026ldquo;to try it out\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to see what happens\u0026rdquo;). Whenever possible, combine different purposes (try out an experimental approach in a way that may also contribute to a particular project, etc.). Whenever possible, work in an open and shared way, so that others can benefit from my use of the AI. Adapting existing infrastructures # Large organisations such as Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) or other public sector organisations require complex IT infrastructure to satisfy their diverse stakeholder requirements. For example, a university will typically have a central IT service offered out across different academic departments but some departments will also run their own more specialised services. Service catalogues provide a way for organisations to describe what technologies and services they support and could be a good starting point to communicate their environmental footprints. This may then be used to raise awareness or feed into data management plans when describing the infrastructure requirements for a new research project. A simple colour-coded gradient scheme could be used to help categorise the technologies and services similar to the ones you see on electrical appliances (or other schemes).\nAs more organisations shift their infrastructure from always on Virtual Machines (VMs) to more on-demand compute services we should start to see benefits in energy consumption, especially in large organisations that have budgeted for VMs that might run with minimal use for periods of time. We will move to a model that is more elastic and can scale horizontally to accommodate changes in demand. Cloud providers such as Amazon have started to provide their own carbon footprint calculators.\nWe are also seeing a shift towards using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) which can provide in-memory caches of popular resources avoiding the requirement to do expensive transfers across backend systems. Understanding the computation or energy benefits from these caches would provide useful insight.\nWithin software development projects it is typical to see CI/CD pipelines being deployed. We need to raise awareness of the impacts of continually triggering what might be a resource intensive process.\nFurther reading # Blair, Gordon S. \u0026lsquo;A Tale of Two Cities: Reflections on Digital Technology and the Natural Environment\u0026rsquo;.

We would welcome collaborators who can comment on other national and regional contexts. This section addresses things you might consider when writing a grant, or planning a project from an internal budget. Our research cultures won\u0026rsquo;t change by themselves: we have to make it happen. By planning our projects responsibly now (rather than waiting for funders to ask for environmental impact statements), we can model the change we want to see in the world.\nKey Recommendations Researchers should include climate impacts in our funding applications. Where there is no dedicated section to do so, other sections (such as Justification of Resources and Data Management Plan) can be used as a workaround. Funders should update application processes to ensure the research they fund is aligned with climate targets. The timescale is tight, so projects already underway should also review their climate impacts (if this was not done at the application stage). The data, tools and skills to design climate optimal research is not yet widespread. Temporary suspension of carbon intensive activities is recommended as we build capacity. Funding Landscape # Writing in early 2025, our view is that:\nRequirements will change. The UK funding landscape is set to change, and researchers should collaborate proactively with funders to co-produce the next generation of funding allocation mechanisms. But we don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait. In the meanwhile, there is plenty of scope within existing funding application frameworks to propose sustainable research. For example in UKRI applications, the Justification of Resources and the Data Management Plan sections can be used to reflect on digital carbon and wider sustainability and justice issues. More transitional guidance from funders is welcome. Funders have signalled that they are open to existing frameworks and guidance being interpreted in this way. The authors of this toolkit welcome this, and invite funders to actively signal the direction of travel and the interim arrangements (especially to peer reviewers). We need, urgently, to \u0026lsquo;green\u0026rsquo; our research. This is a time of transition. The UK has declared a climate emergency, as have universities and research organisations across the sector. Major research funding bodies are prioritising decarbonisation, sustainability, and just climate transition. Use of Information Communications Technology (ICT) is widely recognised as a major source of carbon emissions.\nHowever, with the exception of the Wellcome Trust, these funders are not yet explicitly asking applicants about the sustainability or climate justice dimensions of their projects. Revisions to application processes take time, partly because of justifiable concerns about making applications more onerous: increasing the work that goes into applications can have its own implications for equity and justice.\nThe Digital Humanities Climate Coalition supports the revision of funding processes to centre sustainability and climate justice. We also argue, however, that existing application frameworks can also accommodate sustainability and climate justice considerations. In this transitional time, these frameworks can be interpreted flexibly to provide reviewers with relevant information, so that they can favour sustainable research and reject unsustainable research.\nInterpreting UKRI Environmental Sustainability Guidance for the Digital Humanities (2025) is a short guide published by the DHCC, consolidating some of the signals that UKRI and other funders have made that they support consideration of digital sustainability in funding applications.\nThe Planet Centric Design toolkit was created more for business and innovation contexts, but there are tools and exercises there that could be adapted either for bid development or for the early stages of a project.\nData Management Plans # One area of special interest for this toolkit is the UKRI\u0026rsquo;s Data Management Plan (DMP). There are also opportunities to include information of this kind in the Ethics, Case for Support, and Justification of Resource sections. We recommend that you read this section in conjunction with the annotated DMP in \u0026lsquo;A Researcher Guide to Writing a Climate Justice Oriented Data Management Plan\u0026rsquo;, by the DHCC Information, Measurement and Practice Action Group.\nA DMP outlines a project\u0026rsquo;s approach to managing data through a response to a series of prompts on data creation, storage, sharing, and ethics, which are provided in the application guidance. UKRI guidance also points researchers to resources they might find useful in preparing a DMP and encourages applicants to demonstrate knowledge of institutional policies and procedures. Some grant writers find the DMP useful since it tends to focus one on the minute material detail of the research process (exactly what data will be created, by whom, when, etc.). However, the DMP is sometimes handled by specialists who may not be closely involved in the project, and/or via templates or text that is copy-pasted and lightly edited.\nNeither the DMP application guidance nor its associated assessment criteria currently explicitly refer to the climate crisis or environmental emergency. However, funders have indicated an openness to researchers proactively interpreting existing DMP guidance for sustainability and climate justice. Reading DMP guidance (e.g. in the AHRC Funding Guide) from a climate justice perspective makes it clear that its prompts are worded with sufficient openness that they enable researchers to respond in ways which align with sectoral and national climate commitments.\nFive areas can be immediately considered when writing a DMP:\nEnergy proportionality. In the Royal Society\u0026rsquo;s report Digital Technology and the Planet (2020), a key principle of the chapter on Green Computing is \u0026rsquo;energy proportionality\u0026rsquo;. For a researcher writing a climate justice-oriented DMP, the imperative here is not to produce numbers that show their anticipated energy use per month by some measure. Rather it is to demonstrate that the research design seeks to ensure that the resources used (e.g. hardware purchases, compute time, data storage) will be proportional to the results produced (e.g. outputs, anticipated findings, impacts). Minimal Computing approaches may be useful.\nResource proliferation. A key finding of The Shift Project\u0026rsquo;s report Lean ICT: Towards Digital Sobriety (2019) is that increasing the lifetime of professional laptops from 3 to 5 years could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 37%. Equally, recent and important long form studies like Kate Crawford\u0026rsquo;s Atlas of AI (2021) have underscored the ecological impacts of device proliferation. For a researcher writing a climate justice-oriented DMP, the imperative here is to justify the environmental costs of new device purchases, to demonstrate alignment with institutional policies on device recycling (e.g. does your institution follow or go beyond Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) regulations in their approach), and to consider and explain the benefits of using refurbished devices if appropriate. For example, if external hard drives purchased for a previous project and pooled by your research group are serviceable and within warranty, they may be perfectly usable for a future project that seeks to take a climate justice-oriented approach to data management, and can be described as such in your DMP.\nComputationally intensive research. Computer time requires energy use. Lannelongue, Greanley, and Inouye give us tools to calculate this in their 2020 paper \u0026lsquo;Green Algorithms: Quantifying the Carbon Footprint of Computation\u0026rsquo;. In turn their \u0026lsquo;Green Algorithms\u0026rsquo; service gives us an interactive way to understand this energy use relative to driving a car, taking a flight, or planting trees, a way \u0026ndash; in short \u0026ndash; of describing energy proportionality. For a researcher writing a climate justice-oriented DMP, the imperative here is to describe the decisions taken about the purchase of storage and storage services that relate to and overlap with computationally intensive research activities. For example, that the energy source mix for cloud providers have been investigated, or that data will be structured and stored in ways that reduce compute time and the need for brute force approaches.\nWhere measurement is challenging, err on the side of caution. Good quantitative data on environmental impacts can be hard to come by. Building capacity in this area is important. However, don\u0026rsquo;t be shy to make choices that appear more sustainable to you, even if their positive contribution is not quantified.\nIdentifying relevant standards, frameworks, and guidelines. There are by now many resources that support climate justice across many different aspects of project management. These range from guidelines to minimise the carbon footprint of events, to standards for stakeholder mapping and engagement, to database tools for estimating the carbon intensity of procurement decisions. There are also institution-level standards with project-level relevance (e.g. the Science Based Targets initiative, often referred to as SBTi). These all involve some form of data collection and management, and as such, the DMP is an appropriate place to include them.\nThese considerations fit within existing guidance. For example, the prompt that asks whether there are \u0026lsquo;any legal and ethical considerations of collecting the data\u0026rsquo; (p. 56) raises the possibility of discussing the ethics of over-producing data that need energy and resources to be stored. Similarly, answers to the question \u0026lsquo;How long will the data be stored for and why?\u0026rsquo; (p. 56) might reasonably balance long-term preservation of research outputs with the imperative to reduce the proliferation of data on public facing services that are unused for long periods. Finally, the requirement that the applicant and their institution have \u0026lsquo;considered all the risks, and storage will be in line with the institution\u0026rsquo;s data management policy\u0026rsquo; prompts reflection on long-term data storage, the adaptations to climate change required to ensure long-term storage, and the entanglement of institutional data management policies with environmental strategies.\nWe recognise that not all researchers will have the knowledge and expertise to develop these lines of thinking and to make informed decisions. We are also mindful that researchers may wish to \u0026ldquo;play it safe\u0026rdquo; and not risk a bid by including climate justice-oriented practice that may be new to them. However, the scientific advice is clear that there is an imperative to act immediately.\nWe hope this short guide will enable researchers to be bold in interpreting the DMP guidance, rather than seeing climate justice-oriented actions as another box to tick. Climate justice-oriented data management practices can be threaded through the research programmes of all researchers applying for UKRI funding. There is nothing stopping us apart from developing our knowledge so we can define the appropriate actions to take.\nThe Data Carbon Scorecard may also be useful to apply. There are nine questions, each answered either green, amber, or red. The output is a score out of nine (lose one point for every red, half a point for every amber). For example, \u0026ldquo;Size of data asset is less than 2gb (green), 2-3gb (amber), more than 3gb (red).\u0026rdquo; And, \u0026ldquo;Data is batch processed (green), data remains static (green), data receives near real-time updates (amber), data received real-time updates (red).\u0026rdquo;\n**Suggested DMP Citation:** Researchers who have referred to this guidance in developing a DMP may optionally include wording such as, *\"This DMP is aligned with Digital Humanities Climate Coalition's 2022 recommendations on data management and climate justice.\"* Should you footprint your project? # *\"To give just one example, did you know that the very notion of a personal carbon footprint --- a concept that's completely ubiquitous in discussions about personal responsibility --- was first popularized by BP as part of a \\$100 million per year marketing campaign between 2004 and 2006?\"* [Tracing Big Oil's PR war to delay action on climate change](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/09/oil-companies-discourage-climate-action-study-says/), *Harvard Gazette*, Geoffrey Supran, Sept 2021 (Accessed 4 April 2022) It is not our responsibility, nor our priority, to directly measure the carbon impact of our research. Often we won\u0026rsquo;t even need to make precise estimates. However, we do all urgently need to develop a degree of carbon literacy, and carrying out footprinting exercises can be one great way to learn. Whether this is something you might do at the grant-writing stage, and/or include in the resources you are requesting to do on a funded basis, depends on your individual circumstances.\nLabos 1point5\u0026rsquo;s GES1point5 and the Thoughtworks Cloud Carbon Footprint are examples of carbon footprinting tools (for labs and for cloud usage respectively); The DIMPACT tool estimates emissions associated with audiovisual streaming and other digital activities; the GHG Protocol also offers various tools. The Carbon Ladder is a tool written from a Knowledge Management perspective, and the associated Data Carbon Scorecard is a relatively light-touch tool that may help you to plan a new project. For estimating the embodied carbon of devices, Quantis\u0026rsquo;s Product Attributes to Impact Algorithm might be used. The Software Carbon Intensity Specification is designed to score a software system\u0026rsquo;s carbon emissions. Tools like Website Carbon Calculator and Ecograder can estimate a website\u0026rsquo;s carbon impact.\nThe desire for precise data can sometimes be counterproductive. Rough qualitative understandings are often enough to help us make sustainable decisions. Decisions that may initially require research can become fast, easy and intuitive over time. \u0026ldquo;Is doing it this way more or less carbon intensive than doing it that way? Are they in the same ballpark, or completely different orders of magnitude? Is the intuitive approach OK here, or do we need to assess this more rigorously?\u0026rdquo;\nOne useful concept here is Emissions Factors (EF). Put in simple terms, an EF gives a sense of how carbon intensive something usually is. The IPCC maintains a database of EFs. In the UK, the Department for Business, Energy \u0026amp; Industrial Strategy provide spreadsheets which include Emission Factors. By multiplying the values listed there with your own \u0026ldquo;activity data\u0026rdquo; (for example, financial spend, or miles travelled in a car, or tonnes of plastic waste disposed, etc.) you can generate an estimate of the carbon impact. For power draw from the grid, they suggest a blanket 213g CO2 equivalent per kWh. However, a tool like Carbon Intensity can help to drill down into the details, providing a regional estimate based on what plants are actually generating electricity.\nHowever, definitive EFs are often not available for the type of activities that, as researchers using digital tools, we may want to know about. Thoughtworks\u0026rsquo;s Cloud Carbon Footprint estimates emissions based on data centre billing data in four usage categories: Compute, Storage, Networking and Memory (RAM). It is partly based on Etsy\u0026rsquo;s EFs (called the Cloud Jewels).\nWe are currently in an interim period, during which the data, skills and tools for sustainable decision-making are built and shared. But we do not have to decide now, once and for all, how research will be conducted in the future. It would be irresponsible to continue to emit on the basis of business-as-usual as we scope, gather data, and build capacity. We therefore recommend the bold use of moratoriums on carbon intensive activities.\nPublishing and archiving # There are complex questions around what to keep and how to keep it. There are a few suggested resources in the Working Practices section of this toolkit.\nTravel and catering # Travel and catering may also be important to consider at the grant-writing stage. The short version is to fly less and to serve plant-based food. There is further information in the Working Practices section of this toolkit.\nInnovative approaches to innovation # Funding bodies generally like innovation. So why not include experiments in sustainability in your project proposal, in areas such as publishing, archiving, storage, signage, communication, travel, food, events, activities, physical materials, locations and places, lighting, heating and cooling, aesthetics, resource sharing, moratoriums, or whatever else you can think of?\n[Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/ is a large network across Europe focused on climate innovation. EdgeRyders\u0026rsquo;s [https://edgeryders.eu/t/the-future-of-ecological-urban-living/12097](The Future of Ecological Living) is filled with interesting and provocative suggestions in a variety of domains.\nChoosing research questions # It is important to adapt our research methods to make them less carbon intensive, and to improve our awareness of our environmental impacts.\nBut can we also corral our research communities to more directly investigate environmental issues? For example, humans interact with and through Information Communication Technology (ICT) in unpredictable ways; \u0026ldquo;how ICT changes consumer behavior \u0026hellip; seems to be an underexplored, but essential aspect of the causal mechanisms that have to be understood for predicting the environmental impact of digitalization\u0026rdquo; (Bieser and Hilty 2018). A literature review carried out by Freitag et al. (2021) found no strong consensus about the future of ICT carbon footprints, including \u0026ldquo;disagreement\u0026rdquo; whether or not\nenergy efficiencies in ICT are continuing energy efficiencies in ICT are reducing ICT\u0026rsquo;s carbon footprint ICT\u0026rsquo;s carbon footprint will stabilize due to saturation in ICT data traffic is independent of ICT emissions ICT will enable emissions savings in other industries renewable energy will decarbonize ICT. Another literature review on remote working only weakly confirmed the \u0026lsquo;common sense\u0026rsquo; view that remote working saves energy; 26 of 39 studies suggest that it does save energy, however \u0026ldquo;differences in the methodology, scope and assumptions of the different studies make it difficult to estimate \u0026lsquo;average\u0026rsquo; energy savings\u0026rdquo; (Hook et al. 2020).\nMore broadly, climate change gives rise to a variety of political, ethical, and philosophical issues. Within the arts and humanities, these have long been the concern of the environmental humanities, and fields like the Digital Humanities have plenty to explore in terms of the cultural construction of technologies (everything from email to Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage), and the use and interpretation of data and models.\nHowever, climate research funding has heavily favoured the natural sciences (see figure). \u0026ldquo;Limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require rapid and deep alteration of attitudes, norms, incentives, and politics.\nSome of the key climate-change and energy transition puzzles are therefore in the realm of the social sciences\u0026rdquo; (Overland and Sovacool 2020) \u0026mdash; we can also add, the realm of the arts and humanities.\nFunding for climate research in the natural and technical sciences versus the social sciences and humanities (USD).

This section is intended to help you make informed decisions about the research process as a whole, from using devices to communicating with your team. See also the Decision Trees and Grant Writing sections.\nKey Recommendations The easiest way to reduce your devices' impact on the enviroment is to use them longer, so use a resource such as iFixit to investigate their longevity and repairability. Many new convenient technologies, such as 5G and videoconferencing, come with increased data traffic, which means more carbon cost. Read: Bibliography and raw ideas can be found in this Frameapad. Using digital devices in general # Device lifecycles\nHardware has an embodied carbon cost, in addition to whatever electricity it uses. It is best to use devices as long as possible e.g., to repair them when possible. If you purchase a device through your institution, it is advisable to require the longest possible warranty for all newly purchased devices (this is of course also true if you purchase the device for individual use). There has been a growing awareness of the importance of repairability, which is now used as a selling point by companies. Sometimes it is more a greenwashing argument than an actual indicator of repairability (see as an example this Greenpeace assessment of the repairability of some smartphones, laptops and tablets).\nThere are a few companies that are leading on repairability of device components: Fairphone and Framework are particularly exemplary, but most smartphone, tablet, and computer companies still look for ways to make repairability difficult. See how your device scores on the iFixit repair guides. iFixit also has \u0026lsquo;Teardown\u0026rsquo; reports on various devices that are worth consulting.\nAdditionally, repairable devices are usually much easier to upgrade. If your device is becoming slow or outdated, look at whether a few simple changes can breathe new life into it. Common upgrade options, which can often be done at home or by someone nearby, include increasing memory, changing a battery to a new one, and replacing old hard drive disks with larger capacity ones, or faster SSD-based versions.\nWhen looking at purchasing a new device, also strongly consider buying a second-hand or refurbished device. These are often sold updated with partly new hardware, and/or fresh software installs. Ideally look for a seller that offers a decent warranty period as well.\nFor your old devices that are broken beyond repair or upgrade, you can inquire into the forms of recycling that are possible. Check online for WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment disposal options: in the UK Recycle Your Electricals is one helpful tool. EU WEEE regulation is explained in German here. In French it\u0026rsquo;s DEEE, and you can explore Ecosystem.eco and Ecologic France.\nIn order to have a precise idea of the environmental footprint of a device, you can consult the corresponding Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA, here for an explanation in French) that hardware companies usually provide. LCAs are never fully accurate - some of the information they contain are rough estimates, and the criteria that are communicated are only a handful from a long list. But they remain the best way of assessing the digital footprint of a device or hardware.\nDevice types\nAll in all, the fewer devices you purchase and use, the better. The longer a device is used (maybe getting repaired and upgraded), the better. Thinking through what you need a device to do, and how long you intend to keep it for, can not only extend the lifetime that you use the device for (avoiding unnecessary upgrades), but also give you a more enjoyable experience. Embodied carbon (the carbon emissions associated with manufacturing hardware) is a major component of our global digital footprint.\nThe choice of device also plays an important role when it comes to the amount of electricity consumed. For example, for streaming one hour of content via good wifi in HD quality, a laptop uses 9g CO2, a tablet 1.2 g and a smartphone 0.5g (and a television 48g) (source). Choices regarding peripheral hardware like mouses and keyboards can also make a difference to energy consumption. While the type of connection (cable vs. bluetooth) is marginal (see this thread on Stackoverflow), some devices also require batteries that need to be replaced or recharged regularly.\nSometimes, you might be able to work faster with a laptop than with a smartphone, or with two monitors rather than one. At other times, the screen size may not influence what you do or how much time you need to do it. Accordingly, it may not be necessary to switch devices or use multiple monitors for a given task; try stepping back and reflecting on the kind of device you really need for the task in hand. For example, you could unplug your second monitor and only plug it in when it helps you work more efficiently (the monitor itself not only has a considerable carbon weight but it also requires much more energy than your laptop).\nOf course, every digital device uses electricity; we don\u0026rsquo;t need to stop using our devices, but should be conscious of our choices and their relative environmental costs.\nThere are various ways of estimating the embodied carbon of devices. Lövehagen et al. (2023) compare three methods, and find some significant variations in the results: \u0026ldquo;The total embodied carbon emission of the LCA/PCF is about 35% higher than the result of the Supply Chain approach, while the Vendor Reporting approach is about 16% lower.\u0026rdquo; Lövehagen, N., J. Malmodin, P. Bergmark, and S. Matinfar. ‘Assessing Embodied Carbon Emissions of Communication User Devices by Combining Approaches’. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 183 (September 2023): 113422. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2023.113422.\nFootprinting devices for procurement\nPx3 offers the DCF (Dynamic Carbon Footprint) tool to public sector organisations including universities. Once you have registered and been approved, the tool offers comparisons of the carbon footprints of a wide range of the current range of IT devices such as laptops and desktops, and allows you to project how many years the device will be kept, and where it will be used.\nUsing an operating system # We cannot say that one operating system (like Windows, Linux, MacOS) is better from a carbon footprint point of view than another. There are too many different versions of the systems to compare them in the abstract. But we can check whether there are a lot of elements running in the background, and whether there are a lot of programs that run automatically on start-up, when we don’t need them at that moment.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using a laptop, check if your fan is operating at maximum power more than you would expect - this may indicate that some software is doing more work than you\u0026rsquo;re aware of. Windows 10 users can check battery usage by app, while Mac users can check for software\u0026rsquo;s energy usage using the Activity Monitor. Various tools are available for Linux users, including \u0026rsquo;top\u0026rsquo;.\nTowards minimal operating systems\nUnikernels provide a light-weight alternative to traditional VMs or containers. Technologies such as MirageOS offer a declarative way to build statically compiled binaries that can run directly over a hypervisor or even over bare metal. This approach allows minimal systems to be built which contain the exact functionality required for the task, even down to being able to specify what parts of a network stack are required. This not only provides opportunity for improving the security of the running system but also can result in energy savings compared to traditional operating systems such as Linux.\nWatch: Leaving legacy behind. Reducing carbon footprint of network services with MirageOS unikernels, Hannes Mehnert. Day-to-day working and data traffic # The Digital Carbon Footprint tool from Digital Emissions is an interesting calculator that focuses on everyday activities such as emailing, using social media, Zoom, Virtual Learning Environments, etc.\nNew technologies for facilitating data traffic, like 5G, come with a massive growth of data consumption. In terms of impact, the rule of thumb for least energy intensive to most would be: Wired connection \u0026gt; Wifi \u0026gt; 3G \u0026gt; 4G \u0026gt; 5G. A poor internet connection has a better carbon footprint than a strong one.\nFor example, let’s imagine you use a smartphone for one hour and you stream something in HD quality. With a \u0026rsquo;low\u0026rsquo; Wifi connection you might need 4g CO2 in total, with a \u0026lsquo;high\u0026rsquo; Wifi connection you might need 10g CO2 in total. Source: The Carbon Footprint of Streaming Video - Fact-Checking the Headlines.\nBest practice around emailing, especially storage, remains a subject of debate, and we invite perspectives and evidence to inform future editions of the toolkit. You can minimise the impact of emails by following a few simple rules. First, avoid integrating an image footer as a signature in your emails. Second, avoid emailing large groups of people unless it is necessary. Third, a link to a document, rather than an attachment, may save energy.\nEmails are stored as long as they are in your inbox or in subfolders, so some savings may be made by clearing them out regularly. You can prioritise emails with attached files. There is a small energy cost associated with deleting emails, although our current understanding is that this is typically outweighed by the benefit. However, it\u0026rsquo;s complex and it varies from case-to-case. After all, your emails could be stored on a server powered by clean energy, while the laptop you use to spend time deleting them could be powered by dirty energy (or vice-versa). You can also make sure you regularly unsubscribe from newsletters etc. you\u0026rsquo;re not opening: although this also seems to be something that is asking for a more automated solution in the long-run.\nFurther reading:\nLuciano Rodrigues Viana et al., \u0026lsquo;Can sending fewer emails or emptying your inbox really help fight climate change?\u0026rsquo; (2022). \u0026ldquo;Knowing that 85 per cent of email traffic is actually spam, sending fewer emails at the individual level would have a limited influence on decreasing the amount of email traffic on the web.\u0026rdquo; Luciano Rodrigues Viana et al., \u0026lsquo;Sending fewer emails will not save the planet! An approach to make environmental impacts of ICT tangible for Canadian end users\u0026rsquo; (2022). \u0026ldquo;Overall, the main sources of impacts are, in order of importance, the manufacture of electronic devices, the use of electronic devices, and viewing of video streaming. Some iconic digital activities, such as sending emails, contribute very little to a user\u0026rsquo;s annual impact.\u0026rdquo; Sarah Walkley, The Carbon Cost of an Email (2024). \u0026ldquo;In the grand scheme of things, the impact of email is not the biggest carbon problem humanity faces, but it is an easy one to tackle. [\u0026hellip;] There are a number of things that you can do that not only keep email volumes to a minimum, but are also beneficial to tackle the stress and anxiety that comes from email overload.\u0026rdquo; Think Before You Thank. This is to be read critically. Are thank-you emails \u0026ldquo;unnecessary\u0026rdquo;? Are \u0026ldquo;unactionable\u0026rdquo; emails always \u0026ldquo;unnecessary\u0026rdquo;? Do thank-you emails convey information? What phatic and emotional functions might they fulfil? How might a thank-you email alter the paper-trail? Might we imagine alternative definitions of \u0026ldquo;unnecessary\u0026rdquo;? Does everyone living in the UK send on average 10 unnecessary emails per week? What kind of average? What are the details of the \u0026ldquo;Censuswide research\u0026rdquo; methodology that produced this figure? Did it involve self-reporting? Have various selection biases and cognitive biases been adequately addressed? What interest does a company like Ovo Energy have in advocating for people to send fewer thank-you emails? Email Expiry Date Project Sharing files. You might think about using a download link (e.g. provided by Cloud storage) to share documents instead of sending them via e-mail. It is advisable to use online documents especially when: 1) the shared document has a large file size, 2) you have a high number of recipients.\nDocuments stored in cloud or network drives require traffic for saving files and synchronisation. Network drives usually synchronise file-by-file, which means each change will result in uploading the document completely again. Especially when editing large files, you might consider copying them once to your local drive, editing there and then copying the edited version back when you are finished. Most cloud solutions only require traffic for the modified parts of a file. On the backend, cloud storages usually synchronise automatically on every modification. You can disable the client temporarily or turn on cloud synchronisation only when you need it in order to save energy from additional, superfluous traffic. Generally, saving the document less often will reduce energy consumption if you edit remotely stored documents.\nEditing documents online together is a good solution to avoid frequent email traffic, besides the advantage of synchronous editing or synchronisation. However, each time you open an online document, the application needs to be loaded into your browser memory, which creates a lot of traffic. Additionally, it creates traffic by permanently synchronising your edits, which you cannot turn off in an online environment (consider also traffic by tracking, see below: Browsing). It also relies on a permanent internet connection (see above: Data Traffic). Depending on the type of information you need to communicate, it is advisable to opt for a light-weight tool (e.g. EtherPad) for taking collaborative notes.\nBrowsing on the Internet causes data traffic. As a general rule, more data privacy also means less data traffic. You can track your browsing footprint with the Carbonalyser tool developed by the Shift Project to identify traffic-intense websites. A lot of traffic remains invisible to the user: ads, tracking and social media functions are being processed in the background (cf. https://whotracks.me/). It is possible to avoid some of this invisible traffic with browser extensions (AdBlockPlus, Ghostery, uBlockOrigin; for general advice see WikiHow). See also Carbon Brief / IEA response to Shift Project\u0026rsquo;s 2019 report.\nEditing documents locally on your machine sometimes consumes unnecessary energy when additional features are running in the background of your program. For example, you can save energy by turning off automatic grammar/spell check (and activate it for final review of a document, for example). If your document is very large and you use cloud storage or a network drive, consider turning off the autosave function, or adjust it to a larger interval in order to reduce synchronisation traffic. Also check for further features in your text editor that may not be required to run all the time – essentially everything that checks the text permanently in the background and needs to go through large vocabularies.\nVideoconferencing is less carbon intensive with cameras switched off. This is another complex area, however, since it relates to human sociality and connection. If we try to be too strict about seeing one another\u0026rsquo;s faces online, could this start to impact our decisions to travel vs. working remotely? In the future, better data on the impact of work-related videoconferencing may help to decide whether this is a carbon-saving measure worth prioritising. For now, we recommend experimenting with a mixture of cameras on and cameras off, especially once working relationships are well-established.\nWhat about streaming in general? Streaming is among the more energy-intensive everyday activities we do digitally. A 2021 white paper from DIMPACT and Carbon Trust, partly funded by Netflix, suggests that watching an hour of video emits on average 55 grams of CO2 equivalent. \u0026ldquo;The European average footprint estimated in this white paper is approximately 55gCO2e per hour of video streaming for the conventional allocation approach. (This estimate uses a European average grid emission factor, a representative mix of viewing devices, and network energy intensity figures for 2020.) For comparison, the emissions from microwaving a bag of popcorn for four minutes is about 16gCO2e (also using a European average grid emission factor), while driving 100 metres in an average petrol car emits around 22gCO2e. These footprint figures for video streaming are comparable with some other recent estimates. However, there are also some previous studies with much higher estimates, the main reason for the difference being that those studies used older network energy intensity figures which are significantly higher than figures relevant to 2020\u0026rdquo; (DIMPACT and Carbon Trust, 2021). By contrast, Moulierac et al. (2023) put the figure higher, at 60-400 grams of CO2 equivalent per hour.\nSee also Seger et al. (2023), Reducing the Individual Carbon Impact of Video Streaming: A Seven-Week Intervention Using Information, Goal Setting, and Feedback. Julie\u0026rsquo;s Bicycle, a charity that supports arts and culture organisations with their environmental sustainability, has a 2022 report Environmental Sustainability in the Digital Age of Culture, which may also offer some useful guidance.\nDigital Decarbonisation / Streamline the Stream Challenge # Should we be trying to shift norms around video streaming? Here's an idea, see what you think. **Halfway through every videoconferencing call, switch off your camera.** Switch it on again near the end to say goodbye. If there's a good reason to make an exception, no problem, leave your camera on. Or you can turn it off, and turn it back on again when you need it. Try doing this in a casual way, and copy-paste something like this into the chat: \"This year I'm participating in the Digital Decarbonisation challenge, turning off my camera for the second half of every videocall to reduce energy consumption (unless it really needs to be on). For more information, see the Digital Humanities Climate Coalition Toolkit: https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/working-practices.html\" If you want, you could also disable incoming video. Might this catch on? Maybe it needs a catchier name. \"I am doing the Streamline the Stream experiment.\" \"I'm participating in the Chop \u0026 Chat Challenge.\" \"I'm doing Videoconferless.\" \"I'm doing Digital Darksizing 2024.\" What are your ideas? Meanwhile, when teaching students online, often the problem is just the opposite: trying to get them to switch their cameras *on*! What's that about? Communication methods # How to communicate within your team\nCommunicating within your project team might include sending messages, sharing documents, or videoconferences. While the carbon footprint of the applications and software you will choose is a key element in making this decision, we have included a few additional criteria to help you balance pros and cons of the most frequently used software.\nChoosing a videoconference system\n- Videoconferencing emits carbon, but travel to in-person meetings emits *a lot* of carbon. - Cameras off does make a considerable difference. - But meetings are about more than communicating information, so take a balanced, reflective approach. We don\u0026rsquo;t yet have compelling evidence about which videoconferencing software might be the greenest. If you do, please let us know!

Ad-hoc, tailored solutions are the most resource-intensive and should be avoided where possible.\nMaking (primary) data available\nHumanities projects with a strong digital component usually include the production of primary data in their expected outputs (as detailed in their Data Management Plan), but research in general, even classical humanities research without a strong digital component, combines and/or creates primary resources such as texts, images, video, and audio. The simple fact that your research project deals with a specific combination of sources, connected by the research question you work on, could make it worthwhile to present this data as a publication itself (within the framework of rights associated with the data). This type of publication can be included in your publication list or integrated into a data paper publication (on data papers, see Schöpfel et al., 2019).\nPrimary data should be hosted in a stable, sustainable environment that will provide access and reuse (reuse is key here in terms of environmental footprint). Research, Teaching and Cultural Heritage Institutions usually provide in-house, state-of-the art solutions (such as nextcloud) on dedicated servers. In some countries (like in France), national infrastructures offer this type for services as well. You can also decide to use trusted repositories like github or zenodo. The key here is to avoid one-shot solutions and maximise mutualisations. Generally, this is the best way to ensure multiple site archiving and hence make sure your data will not disappear in a server crash.\nPublishing your results\nFollowing up on the idea that mutualized infrastructure reduces the carbon footprint, the publication on massive preprint servers like ArXiv or HAL presents an excellent ratio in terms of visibility/resource consumptions. Green Open Access is actually green (see here the difference between Green and Gold OA). Gold Open Access comes with a few caveats. First, like for any other website, the fancier the hosting, the more resource-intensive. Pop-ups, banners, pictures, videos on the publisher’s website are loaded every time the paper is accessed and generate a substantial CO2 footprint. What is more, a wide array of well-established publishers harvests researchers’ data (data tracking), which is not only problematic in terms of data privacy, but also in terms of environmental impact that comes from harvesting, storing, and using the tracked data.\nArchiving your data # Sustainable preservation and archiving starts with responsible creation and collection. Put simply, you should not create or collect anything without some consideration of your responsibilities and resources in sustaining it. It is important to take responsibility for actively disposing of data and resources (such as project websites) at the end of a project and/or the retention period set by funding bodies. This responsibility goes beyond any commitments made to research participants to dispose of their data after a given time period.\nBut disposal won\u0026rsquo;t always mean immediate deletion. You may choose to hand over responsibility for data and resources to a steward, such as an academic publisher (in the case of journal outputs), a web archive (in the case of websites), a cultural heritage organisation, or another form of repository.\nYou can open up dialogue with potential stewards around climate. Such dialogue can also help to clarify for all parties what kind of commitment they are making towards the data. How long will they keep it? How will they make it available? What are their own motives and constraints in doing so, and how might these change? What are the compromises and trade-offs you could consider? As Kilbride (2023) points out, \u0026ldquo;Digital preservation has a habit of treating its processes as binary state - preserved or not - and to treat repositories as ‘trusted’ or not. There has to be something in-between, and perhaps that will also be good news for carbon emissions.\u0026rdquo;\nYou can also explore the more technical aspects of preservation together. For instance, Pendergrass et. al (2019) suggest scheduling high-energy and high-bandwidth activities at off-peak times:\nAs many of the energy- and bandwidth-intensive tasks of digital preservation are scheduled events, the barriers to shifting to off-peak use are fairly low. For example, instead of running fixity checks or transferring large amounts of data over the network during the day, scheduling these tasks to run overnight takes advantage of times when both electricity and bandwidth demand are low. (Pendergrass et. al 2019)\nData can be stored more sustainably by keeping it offline or “nearline” (meaning it is not available immediately, but can be made available with little or no human intervention). Sustainable preservation means considering offline storage or nearline storage. Kilbride (2021) comments:\n[\u0026hellip;] every touchpoint of a preservation workflow requires some energy – ingest, fixity check, migration and access for example. So as well as reducing the data volumes we need to ask how many times a file needs to be checked for integrity. We need to question the assumption of large-scale format migration and normalization, and the carbon cost of storing and processing uncompressed files. We need to ask whether instant access – which means spinning disks – is always the best solution. Nearline or offline storage is less good for users but is much healthier for the planet. (Kilbride 2021)\nA recent white paper by Fuji is enthusiastic about nearline / offline storage using tape:\nTape supports green datacenter initiatives by storing data offline without consuming energy. Tape systems can also serve as nearline or active-archive tiers of storage. This means that the data is available for productive use but does not consume processing power and requires minimal environmental resources while the data is not being used. (Cooke et al. 2021)\nJackson and Hodgkinson (2023) encourage Knowledge Management scholars to participate in digital decarbonisation. They advocate for more research into how responsible management and organisational learning can help to mitigate the effects of digital data practices on CO2 emissions. They introduce the \u0026ldquo;data carbon ladder\u0026rdquo; as the first tool to help organizations measure their carbon footprint across the progression from digital data to information to knowledge. \u0026ldquo;The ladder represents a sequential process for completion by data engineers, data stewards, and/or data analysts.\u0026rdquo;\nIt is not only technical questions that should be considered. Careful curation of collections data can contribute to climate justice awareness and foster debate. Even when climate is not the primary focus, curators can include climate change and climate justice angles. There is widespread recognition that climate transition needs to be more participatory and democratic than is currently the case. (Interpret Europe 2020) point out how collections can become focal points for civic activity, and help to ‘imbue strong principles of democracy, equality, tolerance, nondiscrimination and inclusiveness for every participant.’ Cultural heritage institutions can act as trusted spaces where publics form, get informed, enthused, and empowered. Furthermore, collections can help with mainstreaming climate awareness across diverse domains. Some resources include:\nClimate Heritage Network European Association for Heritage Interpretation International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property Indigenous Archives Collective Quantifying the financial costs of sustainable stewardship is difficult, although tools such as Curation Costs Exchange, Total Cost of Stewardship, and Costing (UK Data Service) can help. Making a financial contribution towards ongoing upkeep is not typically costed within research funding applications, but there is perhaps an argument that it should be. Alternatively, a contribution could be made in terms of working with the steward to reduce the cost to them of ‘taking on’ your material. This may involve your taking on the tasks of re-formatting the material, weeding out duplicate or unimportant material, and/or creating additional documentation to ensure that what remains is reusable by others.\nIf you are passing on the outputs of your work to a different steward (or repository) from the one who was caring for the data on which that work was based, you could also consider contacting the original steward to let them know, and perhaps spark further conversations and knowledge exchange.\nTravel # Travel is a huge topic. There is plenty of guidance for academics out there, such as the Flying Less in Academia Resource Guide. More resources are linked to below. The carbon cost of flying is notorious, so it is worth putting it in perspective: globally, flying makes a far smaller impact than agriculture and forestry, or heating and lighting buildings, or road transport. But it is not insignificant, and it is an area that is comparatively easy to cut down on.\nMoratoriums on non-essential travel can be a good way for an institution to show how serious they are on climate transition. The more boldly they define \u0026rsquo;non-essential,\u0026rsquo; the more serious they are.\nImagining new spatialities\nClimate transition does not have to be about self-denial. At best, it can be about transformative innovation that considers justice, inclusion and wellbeing alongside carbon impact. Reducing the amount we travel, and especially the amount we fly, is an opportunity to reimagine the spatialities of research and education. Who should travel, where, when, for how long, for what purposes? One approach might be to replace all travel with videoconferencing. Would this be a good idea? The Digital Humanities have a role to play in analysing the implications.\nIn the transition period of the early to mid 2020s, we recommend boldly cutting back on travel, while collaboratively exploring a longer run strategy. Together we should explore questions such as: What kinds of activity should be done in person, and what should be done remotely? For online and hybrid activities, what are the nuances of various digital tools and platforms? What should we make of Meta\u0026rsquo;s Metaverse, and its relatively power-hungry attempt to create virtual alternatives to physical proximity? Might we invent entirely new formats and ways of working? Conferences, workshops, sandpits, seminars, events, meetings, fieldwork: how might these all be reimagined?\nFlying Less\nFlying Less in Academia Resource Guide, ed. Ryan Katz-Rosen, is a large curated reading list. There have been some recent breakthroughs in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs), so flying itself may arguably become greener in the future. But it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that these biofuels require large amounts of land which could otherwise be allocated to different mitigation or adaptation functions.

Impact of Social Sciences (blog). 11 May 2021. From Research Trips to Research Voyages?\nCutting down travel is obviously important. So too is making sure that when we do travel, it really counts. We might cultivate the ideal of a \u0026lsquo;research tour\u0026rsquo; or a \u0026lsquo;research voyage\u0026rsquo;. This kind of travel would be infrequent, would take the greenest available transport (e.g. rail), and would think about what the researcher can do along the way (not just at the destination).\nDigital Humanities researchers can explore the practical challenges of this. For example, if archival visits were done in a more networked and collaborative way, a visiting researcher could conduct proxy research on behalf of others. Might we develop a platform to support this? Such a platform could have longer term ambitions too, helping universities and other institutions to share their resources to enable slower, more sustainable research trips. For example, might institutions form hospitality networks, to offer accommodation at a discount or for free, where travel is by the greenest available method?\nConferences: Smaller, Online, Hybrid, Unconferences, Alternatives\nThe Nearly Carbon Neutral model suggests presenters pre-recording videos.

Most European universities have now set net zero targets and milestones, as part of broader sustainability strategies. They are integrating climate risks and opportunities into governance and strategy, and embedding climate change across their curriculums. Within institutions like these, advocacy is not about putting climate change on the agenda.\nDespite this, the Higher Education sector is not where it needs to be. In ten points, here is our view on the state of the sector in 2023. This is based on conversations rather than rigorous analysis. But they should be enough, if you work at a Higher Education Institution, to get a rough sense of where your institution is at.\nComparisons are hard right now. Net Zero target dates are not easily comparable across different institutions because of different methodologies and assumptions. League tables are challenging to assemble. Interpreting your institution’s ranking requires careful research. The EAUC\u0026rsquo;s Standardised Carbon Emissions Framework has recently been released. Definitions matter. The terms ‘carbon neutral’, ‘climate neutral’, and ‘Net Zero’ tend to mean different things (and also get defined in different ways). Make sure your institution’s commitment covers Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. Pathways matter. Emissions en route to Net Zero are as important as the Net Zero date itself. It is vital to make as much progress as early on as possible. Make sure your institution has ambitious milestones along the way. If bringing your Net Zero date forward is challenging, you may find more traction bringing forward milestones. Offsets are problematic. Net Zero poses significant greenwashing temptations, especially around the use of carbon offsetting. Not all offsets are equal, and institutions are taking very different approaches to them, and to what counts as an ‘unavoidable emission.’ Make sure your institution also sets an Absolute Zero target date. Benchmarks are seldom science-based. Institutions naturally tend to pick their Net Zero dates by asking, ‘What is feasible for us, given our business model, and given what others in the sector are doing?’ But to have a good chance* of achieving 1.5 degrees, global emissions need to roughly halve by 2030, and reach Net Zero by 2050. Global North countries have ethical and practical obligations to reach these milestones even sooner (e.g. China’s current Net Zero date is 2060, India’s current Net Zero date is 2070). SBTi are pretty busy right now. The Science-Based Targets initiative has yet to expand its work to universities, but a few universities are nonetheless aligning themselves; all should do so. Additionally, some universities that aim (and claim) to be SBTi aligned are not aligned with the latest recommendations. SBTi themselves are under significant pressure to water down their approach to carbon offsetting. The Alliance for Sustainability Leadership in Education (EAUC) is working on implementing SBTi principles in HEIs. Institutional policies and messaging are often inconsistent. If you work for a relatively well-resourced institution in the Global North, it needs to be achieving Net Zero well ahead of the planetary target date (2050) to be consistent with a 1.5 degree target. Some institutions have arguably already reached Net Zero. Implementation details are being worked out. Many institutions have Net Zero commitments that they do not yet know how to deliver. There is a risk of backsliding as the challenges and costs emerge. Risk management is unreflective of the scale of climate crisis. There are opportunities to realise more co-benefits across sustainability and risk management. Some traditional risk management methodologies may not really be suitable for dealing with climate crisis (e.g. around “deep uncertainty” and “tipping points”). Adaptation needs to be transformative. Don’t expect an even picture throughout the institution. In particular, many larger universities have decentralised governance structures, and different parts of the university may be very out of step with each other. “A good chance”: There is intrinsic uncertainty in climate science modelling. Things may be better or worse.\nMove your institution in the right direction # Advocacy will look different in different institutions. It may often involve:\nVisibility and accountability. Building coalitions and keeping sustainability and climate justice high on the agenda. Holding the leadership and other internal stakeholders accountable. Translation for decision-makers. Working to make sustainability and climate justice expertise more legible within business cases and institutional strategy. Translation for stakeholders. Interpreting and curating your institutions’ targets and methodologies and making them more accessible. Up-to-dateness. Making sure that institutional strategy keeps evolving, given the rapidity with which climate issues evolve. Reviewing sustainability strategies and actions in light of the latest science and policy. Diving into complexity. Scrutinising more opaque areas such as procurement, pensions and endowments. Tools. Scrutinising the methodologies and assumptions embedded in your institution’s sustainability tools. Creating accessible and open source alternatives to commercial tools and knowledge bases. Anchoring. Strengthening your institution as a green ‘anchor institution’ within the local economy and community. Creating collaborations and synergies, both inside and outside your institution. Sectoral work. Sharing best practice across the sector, or questioning the framings that are common across the sector. For the UK context, the Accelerating Toward Net Zero report is useful background. Revolutions. Exploring possibilities for more radical, innovative, and disruptive approaches. Just being you. For example, using your expertise, e.g. as an arts and humanities researcher. To some extent this may already be assumed by institutional strategy. Get involved in supply decisions # When it comes to choosing suppliers, university workers may feel like we have our hands tied: by IT Services policies, procurement policies, long-term contracts arranged before our arrival, or even larger structures like procurement consortia or legal frameworks.\nWhen universities work with external suppliers, pros and cons are often checkboxed via a procurement policy or requirements analysis process. This can constrain and limit open-ended learning and innovation — and ‘bake in’ the carbon and ecological consequences of existing, and already centrally paid for, ‘institutional’ digital infrastructures. Opaque supply chains and use of subcontracting (and sub-subcontracting, etc.) can make procurement decisions difficult to interpret.\nProcurement decisions can be highly technical, and procurement teams typically seek expertise across the university. Sustainability is also written into procurement teams’ work, and there may be opportunities to clarify sustainability aims to centre climate justice and rapid transition based on the most up-to-date climate science.\nHESCET helps to estimate the carbon intensity of procurement decisions, but in its current basic form it has quite a few limitations. It is based on a financial spend multiplied by a standardised Emission Factor, so it doesn’t automatically reflect things like “We got a special deal and bought twice as much for the same price,” or “We spent more because we chose a more sustainable supplier.”\nSome procurement-related links:\nHack Education: The history and future of educational technology Southern Universities Purchasing Consortium North Eastern Universities Purchasing Consortium UK Universities Purchasing Consortia partnership EAUC Scope 3 Working Group Spend Matters A 2022 Jisc report on digital sustainability contains a section on procurement, highlighting resources and organisations including the Higher Education Supply Chain Emissions tool (Scope 3 assessment based on Emissions Factors databases), Advanced Procurement for Universities and Colleges (for Scotland), WorldWatchers, carbon accounting software CO2Analysis, and supplier questionnaires from SupplyShift. Approved supplier lists can also take decisions away from researchers. You may have someone who you know would be good to work with, but you need to get them on the approved suppliers list. This may take a prohibitively long time, or may get blocked altogether. It is easy to get discouraged. However, researchers should avoid pushing responsibility onto techs or sysadmins, and engage actively in discussion to find workarounds and push for change.\nOr if you are the one who is making a decision? It is also worth remembering that rules don\u0026rsquo;t have to be followed.\nSuggested Reading: Although it is not specifically focused on technology or sustainability, Moten and Harney’s The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning and Black Study is a thought-provoking read about what it means to work ethically within the constraints of academia today. Empowering Procurement # Procurement teams are almost certainly thinking about sustainability and requiring suppliers to meet various criteria, but there are opportunities for collaboration to ensure that they are asking questions based on the most recent evidence.\nFor example, try to work with your Procurement and IT departments to extend the lifespan of devices (through extended warranties, prioritisation of repairability, workshops on device maintenance, repair cafes, pooling resources, etc.).\nEnergy Procurement # Green tariffs are not straightforward. They push the energy market in the right direction, but energy that comes from the grid is currently supplied by a mixture of renewable and non-renewable sources, whoever your energy supplier is. Multi-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) supporting renewable investment should be used. Also check out the 24/7 Carbon Free Energy Compact. The safest way for your institution to really control its carbon footprint would be to generate all its energy on-site from renewable sources. Short of this ideal, an institution can generate some of its energy on-site, and develop battery storage, to help reduce power draw from the grid (especially when demand is high). Institutions can also explore better scheduling of energy intensive activities.\nProcurement Law # At time of writing in late 2022, UK procurement law is set to be reformed, and there are opportunities to pressure legislators to ensure it is fit-for-purpose. The response to the government\u0026rsquo;s Green Paper by the UK Universities Purchasing Consortia noted that universities incorporate social value into tenders, but did not extensively thematise sustainability or decarbonisation. It is important that any new legislation give institutions the flexibility to prioritise sustainability in procurement decisions, and ideally that it requires procurement in alignment with climate commitments.\nQuestion the Cloud # For many of its users, the public cloud is invisible infrastructure, barely noticeable except when it breaks. The Green Grid is an industry consortium focused on data centre energy efficiency and sustainability, and a gateway to a variety of research and resources. Thoughtworks’s Cloud Carbon Footprint is a promising-looking open source project for estimating the carbon footprint of data centre usage. The Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact is a voluntary initiative in support of the European Green Deal. The GEC has produced some guidelines for procurement teams to grill cloud providers.\nWhen a university or other institution procures data storage and computing power, this is an opportunity to improve our own environmental impact, and to incentivise much larger players to improve theirs. Currently public cloud services are dominated by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Hyperscale datacentres have clear potential to achieve greater sustainability through economies of scale. Furthermore, running a data centre or a server with a low utilisation is typically less efficient, since there is an \u0026ldquo;overhead\u0026rdquo; to having it switched on in the first place (better one data centre at 100% than two equivalent data centres at 50% each).\nAt the same time, these also three companies deeply structurally and culturally committed to expanding the role of digital technology in everyday life, including the use of carbon intensive Machine Learning, whose green claims have been heavily dependent on carbon offsetting. The three cloud giants have also been criticised for their lack of transparency: there is a lot going on in those data centres that we don\u0026rsquo;t know about. In recent years, there has been something of a backlash against the public cloud as a sustainability panacea. See for example the Dark Matter Episode \u0026lsquo;The Cloud Fugitive.\u0026rsquo; Some large companies are bringing workloads that used to be done on the public cloud back onto their on-premise infrastructure.\nHere are just a few questions that might help get the conversations started, both internally with procurement teams, and externally with potential suppliers.\nQuestion Notes What are the broader climate policies of the provider (not just the cloud / data centre parts of its business)? Greenpeace recently explored the green claims of AWS, Google and Microsoft. All three companies are pursuing decarbonisation and at the same time researching AI to support fossil fuel extraction. What are the broader ESG policies of the provider? ESG = Environmental, Social, Governance. ESG has its drawbacks, since it is rooted in risk management. If a company has outward impacts which are damaging to the environment, but which are unlikely to pose the company any reputational or legal risk, then those impacts might not negatively impact their ESG ratings. What is the data centre\u0026rsquo;s PUE, CUE, and WUE? In areas where electricity is cheap, there may not be strong incentives to use it as effectively as possible. The Power Useage Efficiency metric is widely used in the data centre industry, to express how much of the total energy the data centre uses is used in its computational processes, rather than ancilliary processes such as cooling (1.0 would be a perfect score). It does have its limitations (see e.g. Clouded II documentary). Carbon Useage Effectiveness and Water Useage Effectiveness are complementary metrics. None of these metrics can tell us whether the renewable energy used for the data centre could be put to better uses. What is the average localised carbon intensity of electricity powering your data centre(s), for all regions you propose to deliver the service? Renewable energy claims can used \u0026ldquo;market-based\u0026rdquo; accounting or \u0026ldquo;location-based\u0026rdquo; accounting. Market-based approaches can contain useful information, but by themselves they are misleading. Ideally you want both. See if you can get data for the past few years. Make sure you figure out the role of carbon offsets. What ecolabels or certifications apply to the buildings of the data centre? E.g. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), ENERGY STAR, Green Star, Comprehensive Assessment System for Building Environmental Efficiency (CASBEE), the DGNB System, Green Globes, HQE, ISO 50001, Superior Energy Performance, etc. What is the data centre’s carbon footprint? It is important to pressure Cloud providers to be ever more transparent about the carbon footprint (and other environmental impacts) of their activities. Keep in mind that purchasing a Cloud service often won\u0026rsquo;t mean access to one data centre only: you can ask about the provider\u0026rsquo;s entire portfolio of data centres, as well as the specific resources that will be fulfilling your requirements. What methodologies are used to calculate carbon footprint and other environmental impacts? What types of uncertainty are present in this data? Some uncertainties may be impossible to eliminate, but it is good to identify them (and in some cases it may be possible to quantify them). Ask about market-based and location-based carbon accounting. Ideally it\u0026rsquo;s good to have data from both methods. What are the company\u0026rsquo;s decarbonisation targets? What steps have been taken and will be taken to reduce the CO2e emissions associated with the cloud services being tendered? Does the company purchase Renewable Energy Certificates, and/or use Power Purchase Agreements? How about 24/7 hourly matching? To what extent does the provider use carbon offsetting? Carbon offsetting should be avoided as much as possible. The planet’s capacity to offset emissions is limited. The remaining carbon budget is tiny, and the strongest moral and pragmatic claims to that budget lie in the Global South. Ask about Beyond Value Chain Mitigation. Is the data centre’s excess heat redistributed to the district heating network? Heat may also be captured and used in other ways, i.e. as a supplemental power source. Heat re-use in itself is a good sign, although as a rule of thumb, it might also correlate with situating data centres near denser populations where there is more need for scarce renewable resources \u0026hellip; so it is complicated. What are the other local energy needs? Where the data centre is sited, If the data centre wasn\u0026rsquo;t using the energy, who would be using that energy? How much electricity does the data centre generate from on-site renewables? Was there opposition to the siting of the data centre from local stakeholders, and how was it resolved? How is the data centre integrated into the local community now? What is the data centre’s water usage like? You can ask about WUE for example. What jurisdiction is the data centre in? What is the data centre’s exposure and vulnerability to physical climate risks? For example, proximity to flood plains. What climate and ESG-related standards and certifications does the provider use? What forms of independent verification are used? See [Rina Diane Caballar, \u0026lsquo;Tougher Reporting Mandates Ahead for Data Centers\u0026rsquo; (Data Center Knowledge, 2023)] (https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/regulation/tougher-reporting-mandates-ahead-data-centers) What is the provider’s view of the robustness and comparability of their competitors’ carbon disclosures? For example, Google claims to be carbon neutral (based on offsetting), but it’s complicated. Find some tricky questions. Or if you can’t, ask them to describe what most challenges or bewilders them. Try to engage the providers as real people in the complexities of climate transition. Especially where big tech is concerned, how does the provider encourage us to imagine the future in certain ways? Amazon, Google, Microsoft et al. don’t just influence the future via their policies, but also through their cultural influence. As arts and humanities scholars, we are well-placed to start conversations around this. What is the procurement team’s scoring methodology? What proportion is devoted to sustainability, and how has this been derived? Procurement decisions take place in legal frameworks, although they can of course voluntarily go beyond these in securing appropriate suppliers. Doing it ourselves? # There are very significant economies of scale associated with data centre operation. There is generally now little gained from locating data centres closer to users, as edge computing has solved latency issues for most use cases. So for many universities, outsourcing makes sense. However, there are many factors to bear in mind. If you\u0026rsquo;re in an area where energy is already very green, switching from a small local data centre to a cloud solution could increase your carbon footprint. Public cloud solutions also create various incentives and affordances that may or may not benefit sustainability, some of which are explored in the 2022 documentary Clouded: Uncovering the Culture of the Cloud. Universities also frequently operate their own small on-prem data centres for resilience.\nData centres can be integrated into local heating infrastructure e.g. the supercomputer LUMI’s “waste heat will account for about 20 percent of the district heating in the city of Kajaani” (Jakobsson 2021). The University of Edinburgh is home to the Advanced Computing Centre at Easter Bush, near Edinburgh. It provides HPC and data services to academia and the private sector. It is currently part of a pilot study for a novel geobattery technology for recycling heat from cooling facilities (Fraser-Harris et al. 2022).\nClimate change is also associated with deep uncertainty, and tail risks — e.g. political instability or legal / regulatory change where data is housed, the security of optical fibre cables — can legitimately inform decision-making. Methodologies are becoming more available (e.g. Cloud Carbon Footprint) for monitoring on-premise data usage. Universities have strong and distinctive relationships with the public sector, and are used to cross-sectoral collaboration.\nThere may also be complementarities with on-site renewable energy generation. Although trying to compete directly with Amazon or Microsoft is probably not a good idea, we should remain open-minded, creative and bold in our approach to data storage and computation resources.\nFor provocations and inspirations around server autonomy, see Syster Server and Full Stack Feminism. And here\u0026rsquo;s a short article arguing for data centre decentralisation, with many smaller data centres located near their renewable power sources such as solar and wind.\nFurther reading\nChristopher Tozzi, \u0026lsquo;Just How Green is Your Cloud Migration?\u0026rsquo; (Data Center Knowledge, 2023)\nThe Cloud as a factory? # In \u0026lsquo;The Cloud is a Factory\u0026rsquo; (2021), Nathan Ensmenger argues that framing the Cloud as a factory helps us to:\n\u0026ldquo;Restore a sense of place to our understanding of the information economy\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;Appreciate the importance of infrastructure\u0026rdquo; including the Cloud\u0026rsquo;s consumption of water and electricity and its need for \u0026ldquo;roads and bridges and sewer systems\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;Recognize the fundamental interconnectedness (and interdependencies) of all of our infrastructures\u0026rdquo; and use this as a critical lens on technological hype; Consider the supply chains of hardware and elements such as lithium, tin, cobalt, and rare earths, and the \u0026ldquo;set of stories to be told about global politics, international trade, worker safety, and environmental consequences\u0026rdquo;; Identify the effects or lack of \u0026ldquo;compensatory benefits in terms of jobs, tax income, or the development of new infrastructure\u0026rdquo; that may come from establishing a data centre; and \u0026ldquo;Consider the changes to work that the Cloud enables in other industries,\u0026rdquo; for example autonomous vehicles. (Mullaney et al. 2021) Ask questions # Of course you will do what you can in areas where you have discretion. But what is the best way to connect with more senior decision-makers? Some institutions are more democratic than others, some leaderships are more accessible than others. If you do feel cut off, a simple rule of thumb is to show up to all available events where senior management may be present, and make sure that pertinent questions are being asked. Ideas for questions include:\nWhat are the climate risks and opportunities associated with x? Has x been carbon footprinted? Why or why not? What data is available and/or desirable to assess the climate-related risks and impacts of x? What sustainability data and/or analyses have been generated in relation to x? Do we know how much these outputs are being used? How can they be made more useable? Whose infrastructure is being used? Is it clear where responsibility for emissions begins and ends? Can our climate ambition be raised? Can our Net Zero date be brought forward? Can we rely less on carbon offsets? Is x compatible with our sustainability strategy? Is our risk appetite in relation to x appropriate, given our sustainability strategy? Is x compatible with our mission statement and values? How does x advance our sustainability strategy? Our sustainability strategy says x. Are the implications compatible with our mission statement and values? Is our Net Zero strategy compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, given disparities in global capacities to reach Net Zero? How have we assessed the risk of missing our Net Zero milestones, and what is being done to mitigate this risk? How can sustainability work be better resourced and rewarded in all roles throughout the institution? How is the institution’s business model transforming in response to physical and transition climate risks and opportunities? How can we realise co-benefits between our sustainability strategy and other agendas within the institution? Find your internal collaborators # If you’re not already familiar with your institution’s governance structure, check online for information on your executive leadership groups and other key boards, committees, teams, and individual roles. The names and functions of things vary from institution to institution. For a university, some key roles / bodies / terms to explore include:\nSustainability team Chief Sustainability Officer Chief Risk Officer Heads of Schools Vice Chancellor Students Union Union Audit committee Procurement team Senate Reporting requirements group Certification and compliance Health and safety team Business continuity ITS Find your external collaborators # Although this section of the toolkit is focused on advocating within your institution, a lot of it may also apply to how you work with partner organisations on research projects, to support them to develop and deploy digital tools in sustainable ways. For example, DH professionals at universities often work with arts, culture, heritage, and creative industries organisations. Here are a few tools and talking points:\nInternational Energy Association reports and Our World in Data\u0026rsquo;s CO2 and Greenhouse Gas emissions provide some useful high-level context - decarbonising the digital is important and urgent, but we should also make sure we keep things in proportion (and don\u0026rsquo;t miss out on easy, impactful actions outside of the digital). Julie\u0026rsquo;s Bicycle has lots of resources for arts organisations especially (not just focused on digital sustainability). The Networked Condition is a project about \u0026ldquo;the environmental impact of the creation and delivery of artworks using digital technology,\u0026rdquo; including a carbon calculator. Sustainability: A Surprisingly Successful KPI. Joe McGrath, \u0026lsquo;Cost as a Proxy for Carbon: The Inconvenient Truth\u0026rsquo;. From the Green Software Foundation, The Green Software Maturity Matrix is a self-assessment tool for organisations to \u0026ldquo;understand the extent to which they have implemented green principles, patterns, and processes for building and operating their software systems.\u0026rdquo; TOSS is a work-in-progress (as of 2024) from the Green Software Foundation which focuses on organisational change, and seeks to \u0026ldquo;describe a framework incorporating a method that is focused on a decision tree approach. It would also reveal where voids exist, providing ideas for future initiatives.\u0026rdquo; Carbon Literacy Project offer a variety of sector-specific Carbon Literacy Toolkits. Digital Decarbonisation, Data Carbon Scorecard is a lightweight tool for quickly evaluating the potential carbon impacts of a new data related project Proposal for a Technology Carbon Standard. Of course, the digital is not the enemy of the sustainable. Digital technology has a huge role to play in a rapid and just climate transition. Rasoldier et al. (2023) offer some thought-provoking questions we can use to scrutinise the promised benefits of digital innovation. Find levers to drive change # What are the next big digital infrastructure decisions being made within your institutions and are environmental concerns being taken into account? Explore where the decisions are being made, establish collaborative relationships across the institution, and plug into new sources of information. Things may work differently in theory vs. practice, so conversations can be important to build an understanding of how things have been decided in the past.\nSometimes it may be easier to realise impact in less obvious places. Even a committee that does not have climate as part of its core remit still has sustainability and climate risk responsibilities, and will still be making decisions that have implications for your institution’s carbon footprint, climate risk management, and climate justice impact.\nConfront greenwashing and discourses of delay # Most of us are, thankfully, long past the point where our institutions won’t even think about climate transition. But we are still in an era of greenwashing and discourses of delay. These are not always cynically motivated: often they arise through misplaced optimism.\nIn 2009, TerraChoice conducted market research on existing products which made ‘green marketing’ claims. Their ‘Seven Sins of Greenwashing’ are still relevant to conducting and communicating research for tomorrow:\nThe hidden trade-off. Saying something is green by using narrow criteria and ignoring other more important environmental impacts. No proof. Claiming greenness without easily accessible supporting information. Vagueness. Using poorly defined terms, often for marketing or reputational purposes. Irrelevance. Committing to a valid environmental claim, but an unimportant or resolved one. Lesser of two evils. Making true claims within your own category, which distract from greater concerns of the category as a whole. Fibbing. Making environmental claims that are false. Worshipping false labels. Giving the impression of 3rd-party endorsement when the association does not in fact exist. We have come up with seven more:\n“I can’t bear to look!” Greenwashing by omission. An institution may drag it\u0026rsquo;s heels on collecting sustainability data or doing rigorous analyses, especially if deep down it knows it might not like what it will find. Transparency without agency. Even if an institution is being honest, rigorous and bold in how it collects and analyses sustainability, and how it communicates the results … is it checking to make sure this information is actually being used? Is it supporting the creation and empowerment of audiences and users? Passing the buck. Similarly, an institution may disclose climate-related information in the expectation that key stakeholders (students, funders, regulators, the public, etc.) will then take appropriate action, and alter the institution’s operating environment. Convenient benchmarking. It’s natural for organisations to benchmark themselves against similar organisations (e.g. a university will tend to compare itself to other universities in the same country, and perhaps regionally and globally). This can lead to an “eco echo chamber” where entire sectors are behind on climate ambition. Science-based targets are one good antidote, although here too we’ll have to be careful \u0026ndash; science seldom speaks with one voice, and there may be temptations to cherry-pick the most convenient advice. Sustainability as an excuse for every decision. If sustainability is not the real driver behind a decision, it is better to be honest about that. If there are incidental sustainability benefits, that’s great, but frame them appropriately. Otherwise you risk giving the wrong impression about the sustainability costs and benefits of various actions. “A+ for effort, but …” Some initiatives really do contribute in positive ways, but use up significant amounts of time, energy, attention, money and other resources which could be much better used. Should we think of them as a form of greenwashing? Maybe. Of course, we can’t always expect to be perfectly efficient when it comes to climate action. But if the 2020s is to be the decade of delivery, we can’t have (just for example) sustainability leads being asked to devote large amounts of their time to raising awareness with symbolic actions. “It’s ALL just greenwashing!” Of course, it is also possible for something to look like greenwashing, when it is actually making a useful and well-proportioned contribution to climate transition. Better to be constructive and detailed when assessing an initiative, than to make accusations based on a hunch. Lamb et al. (2020) mention climate denialism, climate-impact scepticism, ad hominem attacks on climate scientists, but devote most of their article to “discourses of delay.” They offer this typology:\nThe incentives to greenwash or to delay are set to rise as the global economy decarbonises. As the false forest begins to sprout around us, how do we make sure we don’t get lost in it? There are no easy answers, but this certainly seems to be a space where the arts and humanities can usefully intervene through research, education, and activism. Close reading of green claims, distant reading of large corpori, collaboration with cultural heritage institutions and other trusted sources of information, and innovative approaches to cultivating truthfulness in the public sphere.\nConfronting green colonialism and green extractivism # Broadly speaking, it is communities in the Global South who are most exposed to the impacts of climate change. At the same time, climate change mitigation can be done in ways that disadvantages Global South actors, and reinforces or recreates colonialist power hierarchies.\n\u0026ldquo;The European Green Deal also ignores the environmental impact of Europe’s drive for renewable energy and electric mobility on other parts of the world, where resources for this economic shift will have to be extracted,\u0026rdquo; writes Myriam Douo. A 2024 blogpost by Andreea Belu analyses how the policy narrative around \u0026ldquo;twin transition\u0026rdquo; (digital transition and green transition) has shifted to emphasise securitisation and defense.\nTechno-optimism # \u0026ldquo;Solutionists deploy technology to avoid politics; they advocate ‘post-ideological’ measures that keep the wheels of global capitalism turning.”\nEvgeny Mozorov\nTechno-optimism could be seen as a form of greenwashing, or a discourse of delay, but it also deserves its own special category. It is of special significance to arts and humanities researchers who work on and with technology (e.g. the Digital Humanities).\nTechno-optimism in relation to climate change means putting disproportionate trust in Negative Emissions Technologies, geoengineering, or other emerging or proposed technologies, that either (a) are unproven; (b) are unproven at scale; (c) have potential negative side-effects; (d) have potential negative implications for climate justice; and/or (e) are dependent on political, social and economic conditions in ways that might reasonably undermine their benefits.\nUndue support for technological solutions can undermine carbon emissions reduction (things we know will work: reducing energy consumption, switching to renewals, and leaving unburnable fossil fuels in the ground).\nHere are a few angles on techno-optimism, including pointers to where to find out more. Note also the cluster of related terms: techno-optimism, techno-utopianism, techno-solutionism, techno-fixes.\nIt is useful to historicise emerging climate technologies and energy technologies. One recent history identifies an “overall dynamic which should give climate scientists and policy makers pause for thought before pursuing yet another round of technological promises without social transformation in the hope of averting dangerous climate change” (McLaren and Markusson 2020). After Geoengineering (2019) by Holly Jean Buck is a sympathetic-but-critical exploration of climate engineering technologies. It emphasises how such technologies might have very different impacts on the climate depending on how they are governed, and in whose interests. In Experiment Earth: Responsible Innovation in Geoengineering (2016), Jack Stilgoe writes, “My aim in this book is to draw attention away from risk assessment towards uncertainties: the things we don’t know, that we can’t calculate and that may remain incalculable.” Geoengineering Watch is a campaign site with an emphasis on Solar Radiation Management. Science and Technology Studies and feminist philosophy of science explore the intersection of science, power, knowledge, and culture. E.g. Flegal (2018) takes an STS perspective on solar radiation management, to explore what enables “debates about the management of the representation of a technology which does not yet exist” (Flegal 2018). Indigenous knowledge offers a rich variety of alternatives and critiques to dominant forms of technoscience. Using the language of uncertainty can be a good way to move beyond a crude pro-tech vs. anti-tech impasse. Uncertainty is part of all good science. Often uncertainty can be quantified in ways that are useful for decision-making. Some uncertainty (sometimes described as “deep uncertainty”) is difficult or impossible to quantify or model, but can still be factored into decisions made about technology. Epistemological Luddism See Langdon Winner’s 1977 Autonomous Technology Steven E. Jones, Against Technology: From the Luddites to Neo-Luddism (2006) Lachney and Dotson’s 2018 ‘Epistemological Luddism: Reinvigorating a Concept for Action in 21st Century Sociotechnical Struggles’. Conviviality is an approach to technology Ivan Illich’s 1973 Tools for Conviviality. Illich’s approach is based around building tools that improve autonomy, and he seeks to understand autonomy in a relational and egalitarian way. Vetter (2018) explores links between conviviality and degrowth. Questions. Stephanie Mills’ Turning Away from Technology (1997) includes a useful list of ‘78 Reasonable Questions to Ask About Any Technology’ (findable online tool). For example, \u0026ldquo;Does it preserve or destroy biodiversity? Does it preserve or reduce ecosystem integrity?\u0026rdquo; Don’t Look Up (2021) is a movie about science communication and techno-optimism. Some climate-related techno-optimism is not about decarbonisation directly, but rather about the use of Artificial Intelligence to squeeze more efficiency from constrained resources, and/or develop deep adaptations for a much less hospitable climate. The overlapping fields of Critical Data Studies, Critical Internet Studies, Critical Algorithm Studies, Critical Digital Studies, and Science and Technology Studies more broadly, offer useful perspectives on AI imaginaries. Arts and humanities researchers can play a role in interrogating the hopes invested in AI, as well as in its development, deployment and governance. Build your own legitimacy within your institution # Get in rooms where decisions are made and, where appropriate:\nAppeal to transparency. The operational methods which management uses to make resourcing and strategic decisions is crucial but it is even more crucial that these methods and decisions are being talked about outside of the managerial circles – for accountability and trust. Appeal to the institution’s values, as expressed in its value statement, mission statement, vision statement, and/or existing strategy documents. It is likely that these will use the language of environmental sustainability. (If they don’t, this in itself is something to be addressed urgently). Appeal to collaboration and interdisciplinarity. Climate transition is incredibly complex, and nobody has the full picture. Appeal to reputation. Reputation is hugely important to many universities. (At the same time, reputational risk does not fully capture the ethical imperative to decarbonise and work for climate justice). Appeal to the risk cascades. Climate change does not sit demurely in a box all by itself. If climate action is being weighed against some other priority, think about the ways the two things are already connected. Climate risks transmit into financial risks, reputational risks, etc. Appeal to life and death. Be gentle. Be collaborative. Don’t alienate the people you hope to persuade. But sometimes conversations about governance and strategy can get tangled up in a very financial way of thinking, where everything is ultimately reducible to budgetary implications. Is the real reason universities are decarbonising because they are concerned that low climate ambition will affect student satisfaction scores, recruitment rates, and therefore revenue? No, that doesn’t tell the full story. We know that a just climate transition is about far more than that. Advocate for small changes # Even small changes add up. Are you aware of any policies or common behaviours at your institution which might be generating unnecessary carbon? For example: pictures attached to your signature for marketing purposes, or sharing email attachments back and forth when shared cloud documents are available to you and your colleagues.\nWhen advocating for smaller changes, be sure to focus on easy wins and changes which support a general shift in attitude and attention. Use small changes to prefigure larger changes, to raise awareness, and to address feelings of powerlessness. If a small change would involve constant disproportionate effort, or encourage policing of behaviours, it’s probably not a good candidate to focus on. Use small changes to make your institution a better place overall. Use small changes to help people feel good about climate action.\nFurther reading: In Praise of Smaller Actions. Advocate for big changes # We are all susceptible to dissonant reasoning (see the sections below on greenwashing and discourses of delay). Climate change means big changes are coming (and are already taking place), yet it is easy to imagine that the situation is more stable and constrained than it actually is. We should look beyond existing business models and business cases, beyond existing institutions and social orders, and beyond merely incremental changes. Within our institutions, we can support and encourage each other to always think and act more boldly.\nConnect small changes and big changes # As arts and humanities researchers, we have our own special ways of connecting smaller changes with wider issues. The technical systems we move through are filled with many inefficiencies that could be addressed by better design; these can also be opportunities to think about deeper system change. For example, one archivist for a FTSE100 company started looking into her company’s preservation workflow:\nit soon became clear that literally everything produced by the company was being saved in a range of locations by a range of people across these servers. Even items transferred and already stored on the archive servers were being stored on other department (and personal) drives, leading to copies of some documents reaching double figures. (Williamson 2021)\nAnd one Twitter user has this beautiful confession:\nHello, my name is Graeme, I have a PhD in computing, and I am a senior accessibility consultant, but when I want to type \u0026ldquo;é\u0026rdquo; on a Windows laptop I go to Beyoncé’s Wikipedia page and copy/paste the letter from there.\nWhy do we sometimes play media we are not even paying attention to? Does our operating system or browser make it easier to use Google Search, download and overwrite a file, rather than remember where we saved it on our hard drive? Why do we unintentionally end up with multiple versions of the same file on our hard drives? The structures we occupy create incentives and affordances. Working to transform these, at every level from the structures of a particular user interface, to the structures of extractivist capitalism itself, can help us to develop a “holistic understanding of behaviour that bridges the ‘individual’ and ‘systemic’” (Newell et al., 2021).\nHere are a few ways that the ‘smaller’ things we do in our teaching and research might inform our wider advocacy, both within our institutions and beyond.\n“Work as if you lived in the early days of a better nation,” as Alasdair Gray wrote. Remember that individual agency and systemic change are connected. When our colleagues or students bring up a very good question, “How much difference can the individual make?” it can be helpful to reframe the ‘individual’ as an ‘early adopter,’ or ‘co-producer’ — someone who goes against the grain of existing systems, and/or tries out prototypes, to help new systems emerge. Capture your experience as useable information. When you adopt other environmentally conscious behaviours, note wherever you experience friction with the systems you inhabit. Capture this precisely (a challenge in itself). Use it to advocate for changes (big and small). Reflect on what general lessons might be drawn (and share these). You may wish to explore UX concepts such as choice architecture, choice editing, dark patterns and green patterns. Engage students as researchers. Consider incorporating similar challenges into your teaching and assessment. Give students the resources to recognise the energy impact of their digital activities, and ask them to journal where there may be opportunities to redesign the systems they’re operating in, inspired by minimal principles. You might frame this as auto-ethnography. Widen the conversation. Exploring the redesign of systems to support behaviour change is useful in itself, and easily links to exciting topics across a wide range of fields: minimal computing, sustainable software design, UX design, speculative design, critical media studies, Science and Technology Studies, critical algorithm studies, political economy, psychology, economics, cultural studies, systems thinking, and more. It can also be a way into big questions around the role of technology in climate transition. What are the limitations and risks of techno-fixes? Why can’t we simply design our way out of climate crisis? Might critical design thinking nonetheless inform campaigning and activism? Perhaps we should redesign design too? When should we prototype, test, and iterate, and when might other approaches be appropriate? When should we accept a workaround, and when should we devote resources to solving something ‘properly’? Can we do more to get things right the first time (or at least after fewer iterations), or build in safeguards so that issues which emerge during testing fall within known parameters? Can we better manage technical debt?

How does climate change work? # Carbon and other greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere (especially from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal). Some emissions are then safely removed again (e.g. absorbed by trees), but some hang around in the atmosphere. This traps the sun\u0026rsquo;s energy in our planetary climate, causing average planetary temperatures to rise (called global warming or global heating). The consequences already include wildfires, droughts, loss of soil moisture, famines, disease, heatwaves, loss of arctic ice and rising sea levels, ocean acidification, storms, floods, wildlife extinction, and more.\n2. What are we doing about climate change? # Climate action is usually divided into adaptation and mitigation. Adaptation means doing things to prepare for a hotter climate, such as investing in resilient agriculture, relocating coastal communities, hardening infrastructure, building flood defences, etc. Reducing poverty and inequality has been shown to improve resilience to climate impacts. Mitigation is about doing things to slow and eventually halt global warming. Mitigation includes reducing emissions (by switching from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind) and also increasing the planet\u0026rsquo;s absorptive capacity (reforestation, wetland preservation, restorative agriculture, carbon removal technologies, etc.). Climate justice is also important to mention here. Climate action is seldom uniform in its impacts: one group\u0026rsquo;s adaptation may be another group\u0026rsquo;s maladaptation. Climate transition finance is currently severely skewed to the Global North, even though countries in the Global South tend to be on the frontlines of climate impacts, and the least responsible for climate change, in terms of historic emissions levels.\n3. How much time is left? # It depends. Not long ago, the conversation around climate change revolved around the question, \u0026ldquo;When will we start to take serious action?\u0026rdquo; That has changed.\nNow the questions are about implementation (\u0026ldquo;How are we taking action?\u0026rdquo;) and justice (\u0026ldquo;Which \u0026lsquo;we\u0026rsquo; is taking action?\u0026rdquo;). At the Paris Agreement in 2015, world leaders agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. To have a decent shot at this means the world needs to peak net global carbon emissions immediately (2025 by the very latest), approximately halve net emissions by 2030, and get to net zero by 2050.\nThis 2022 article by Anjana Ahuja contains some interesting perspectives on climate messaging, and how precise deadline framing can be counterproductive.\nClimate action is already happening; it\u0026rsquo;s not happening fast enough; there are tangible benefits to doing things sooner rather than later, and doing them decisively rather than half-heartedly. It seems extremely likely that the 1.5 degree target will be missed, but every fraction of a degree matters.\n4. How does ICT contribute to climate change? # Information technology requires energy, and much of this energy is currently being generated by burning fossil fuels. Globally, Information Communication Technology (ICT) contributes 1.8% to 3.9% of greenhouse gas emissions (Freitag et al. 2021).\nDigital technology has other impacts on the environment. For example, rare minerals are required in the manufacture of hardware. Mining resources such as coltan (for tantalum) and gold is bound up with exploitation and conflict. Disposal of devices and components is also a huge issue. E-waste volumes are vast and growing, and can contribute to climate change (directly, e.g. through greenhouse gas refrigerants, and indirectly, e.g. through missed opportunities for low carbon manufacturing based on reclaimed materials), and can release toxins and other hazardous substances.\n5. What is net zero? # Net zero refers to a situation in which carbon emissions are balanced by carbon removals. The closer we get to net zero, the more global warming slows. Once the world as a whole achieves net zero, the latest science suggests that average global temperature will no longer rise. At the country level, for example, currently Sweden has a pledge to achieve net zero by 2045; France, Germany, and the UK by 2050; China by 2060 and India by 2070. Net zero is also a target at other scales, e.g. city, institution, individual, event, product. There are worthwhile criticisms of the net zero paradigm (and other terms including real zero, absolute zero, and net negative have been suggested as complementary / alternative rallying points); however, net zero is by far the dominant paradigm of current policymaking and strategy.\n6. But environmental sustainability is about more than just climate change, right? # That\u0026rsquo;s right. For example, biodiversity loss, land-system change, altered biogeochemical cycles (phosphorus and nitrogen), and other planetary boundaries. This toolkit emphasises climate change, but these issues are all interconnected.\n7. How should we talk to students, colleagues and other people about climate change? # Climate change communication is a huge field. Three insights are worth bearing in mind.\nMix in positivity and hope. Getting bombarded with the scale and complexity of the challenges can be disempowering and counterproductive. Try to find models for action. In other words (even setting aside optimism vs. pessimism), effective communication identifies actual ways of being, thinking, talking and (especially!) doing. Don\u0026rsquo;t just focus on the constraints that climate action creates, also explore the possibilities it opens up. It\u0026rsquo;s OK not to know everything. Climate change is a huge topic. We often need to make changes on the basis of knowledge that feels very fragmentary. The \u0026ldquo;Advocating Within Your Institution\u0026rdquo; section of this Toolkit contains further suggestions.\n8. What are the major contributors to global warming? # This can be answered in different ways.\n(a) You can break it down in terms of gases. A variety of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and others) contribute to global warming. Carbon is a big contributor (methane in second place), and so other gases are often translated into their carbon equivalents. In this toolkit, we use carbon footprint as shorthand for all greenhouse gas emissions, direct and indirect.\n(b) Carbon footprint can also often broken down by country, and this is important for climate negotiations (the UN COPs etc.). Whenever looking at breakdowns by country, check three things. First, emissions are usually calculated on a production basis, i.e. how much carbon is emitted within national borders. So, countries like China appear to be heavy polluters, whereas countries like the UK seem to be doing well. This is because the UK produces lots of goods produced overseas, whose carbon emissions go on other countries\u0026rsquo; balance sheets. However, country emissions can be accounted in other ways to include imports: on this calculation, the UK does a little worse, but perhaps not as badly as you might expect. Secondly, these rankings typically don\u0026rsquo;t reflect historic emissions \u0026mdash; some countries (like the UK) may appear like they are leading the charge on climate change, but are very much the ones who got us into this fix to begin with. Including historic emissions alters the list of worst polluters significantly. Thirdly, don\u0026rsquo;t forget about population sizes, and check on both absolute and per capita figures. About 1.4 billion people live in China, and about 1.4 billion in India.\n(c) It can also be illuminating to break down carbon emissions by sector. Energy use for transport, within buildings, and for industrial processes accounts for a large proportion of emissions. Agriculture, forestry and other land use is also substantial. There is a fuller breakdown here. Keep in mind that some of these may be easier to abate than others.\n(d) Finally, it can be useful to break down emissions according to wealth. Sometimes climate change has been misleadingly blamed on overpopulation. According to Kartha et al. (2020), nearly half of emissions growth between 1990 and 2015 was attributable to the richest 10%, and the impact of the poorest half was \u0026lsquo;practically negligible\u0026rsquo;.\n9. Where can I find out more about the science of climate change? # Major journals include Nature and Journal of Climate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reviews and synthesises climate science and produces giant thousand-page reports. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat (UNFCCC) is the United Nations entity tasked with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. Some key terms to explore include: anthropogenic climate change, radiative forcing, tipping points, nature based solutions, Carbon Dioxide Removal, land use, adaptation and maladaptation, Integrative Assessment Modelling, model uncertainty, AMOC, and risk cascades.\n10. Where can I find out more about climate justice? # Newell et al. (2021) provide a useful overview of the term \u0026lsquo;climate justice.\u0026rsquo; Other good resources: Climate in Colour, Climate Justice Syllabus, Climate Action Network, UN Sustainable Development Goals, Greenpeace, ASU Center for Science and the Imagination, Friends of the Earth, Panafrican Climate Justice Alliance.\nSome key terms to explore include: transformative climate justice, fossil capital, capitalocene, climate reparations, damage and loss, system change, degrowth / postgrowth, post-development, slow violence, climate and intersectionality, eco-feminism,and ecosocialism.\n11. Where can I find out more about climate policy and climate economics? # Some good resources include the Doughnut Economics Action Lab, Wellbeing Economy Alliance, Carbon Brief, Carbon Tracker, UK Climate Risk, Global Justice Now, Stir to Action, New Economics Foundation, The Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity, WIREs Climate Change.\nSome key terms to explore include: stranded assets, climate risk, Beyond GDP, degrowth / postgrowth, ecosystem services, social cost of carbon, carbon price, carbon tax, carbon leakage, carbon market, damage and loss, cap-and-trade, development banks, blended finance, Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement, Glasgow Compact, ESG, ISSB.\n12. Where can I find out more about climate change and the humanities? # Some good resources include Energy Humanities, SOS-UK, Environmental Humanities @TORCH, The Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment, and the Media Arts and Humanities Sustainability Educator Toolkit.\nSome key terms to explore include: anthropocene, capitalocene, degrowth / postgrowth, animal studies, ecomodernism, ecocriticism, ecofeminism, ecosocialism, transcorporeality, interspecies entanglement, natureculture, and dark ecology.\n13. Where can I find out more about critical technology studies? # Some good resources include the Digital Humanities Climate Coalition, Critical Algorithm Studies: A Reading List, Hack Education, Catalyst, Bulletin of Science, Technology, and Society, Global Forest Coalition, Geoengineering Monitor, Biofuelwatch.\nSome key terms to explore include: tools for conviviality, epistemological luddism, techno-solutionism, techno-optimism, techno-utopianism, critical algorithm studies, critical data studies, critical metric studies, biomimetic, Carbon Dioxide Removal, geoengineering.\n14. Where can I find out more about climate change and the digital? # This toolkit, the Climate Change and the Digital Humanities Zotero Library, the Digital Humanities Climate Coalition, Low Carbon Research Methods, Digital Humanities Quarterly, The Green Software Foundation.\n15. What should I know about offsetting and Negative Emissions Technologies? # For an institution to achieve net zero, it needs to decarbonise its emissions as much as possible (divided across Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions), and then offset its unavoidable emissions. Offsetting should mean taking as much carbon out of the atmosphere as you are putting in. However, in practice, it is possible to purchase carbon credits which allow you to fudge your own carbon accounting, without genuinely removing the stated amount of carbon.\nWhat is an unavoidable emission? This is an extremely subjective judgment. Arguably there is no such thing, although for some people emitting carbon may be a matter of immediate life or death. The key thing to recognise about offsetting is that it is very seductive, because it suggests we might buy our way out of making more fundamental changes.\nHow much carbon can we remove? Nature restoration and Negative Emissions Technologies (NETs) are a necessary part of a successful climate transition, but there are huge uncertainties around them too. Technologies which were recently touted as climate saviours have fallen out of favour as they attracted more scientific scrutiny, especially around their capacity to scale. Currently, the long-term institutional continuity of players in the offsetting industry is not assured. Using land to store carbon can have implications for social justice. There are also limits on how many trees we can plant and how much peatland we can restore (for example). If this stored carbon is tied to the carbon emissions of the latest AI and VR extravaganza in the Global North, then it cannot offset the carbon emissions of developing vital infrastructure in the Global South.\nFrom a net zero perspective, institutions should not be offsetting unavoided emissions. Instead they should be avoiding these emissions through temporary suspension of activities, until better offsetting capacity is developed. However, this is complicated by the fact that commercial offsetting is counting on investment in order to develop. In short, it is a complex and evolving area, and arts and humanities researchers can play our part by scrutinising our institutional strategy.\nFurther Reading # Baillot, Anne. 2023.

A guide to running a DHCC Workshop based on the Sustainability Card Game can be viewed here. The cards can be viewed here, and the rules here. Players take the roles of organisations competing (and perhaps collaborating) to become more digitally sustainable. Two hours, and 3-10 participants, is about right, although it is flexible: we\u0026rsquo;ve played it with groups of 15-20 too. If you\u0026rsquo;d like your own copy of the card deck, get in touch.\nPlease also feel free to contribute to the Digital Sustainability Game Handbook, a work-in-progress.\nThese cards can also be used in other learning activities. For example:\nWarm-up activity. Deal a selection of random ACTION cards to a small group. Have them arrange these on a matrix, where one axis represents the difficulty of implementing the action, and the other axis the impact the action could have. The participants may want to use their own organisations for reference. Once the cards are arranged, choose one or two that look interesting, and have a discussion about them. Optionally, assign roles (organisation, government, stakeholders) and invite them to roleplay, explaining how the action was implemented and what the challenges were.\nNear the end of a workshop. In groups, pairs, or solo, invite participants to browse through the ACTION cards for inspiration of things they could actually do in their organisations. Choose a card, and then write SMART goals inspired by the card. The advice on the card will probably have to be adapted to the real world, and to individual circumstances.\nExamples # Materialities of the Digital (University of Cambridge) # This optional module is offered as part of the MPhil in Digital Humanities and taught by Anne Alexander. The course explores the materiality of digital culture through an investigation of the ‘things’ that undergird our networked world. It also introduces ways of thinking about how these things are made and connected with each other through networks, systems, infrastructures, and architectures with weekly sessions on topics such as cables and networks, data centres, sensors, drones and autonomous vehicles, borders and categories and crowds.\nThe overarching framework for the course engages with Andreas’ Malm’s theorisation of Fossil Capital, paying particular attention to the idea of “seeing power as power”, in other words recognising that the choices made by the designers of machines and systems which convert energy sources into ‘work’ are shaped by capitalist social relations as much as technical constraints and possibilities.\nWe explore these themes both in the classroom and through other forms of learning, for example through a walking-tour and field trip to the West Cambridge Data Centre, to examine the adiabatic cooling system and experience the heat and noise of the data halls firsthand. Students have also taken up the challenge of relying on a solar battery to charge their mobile phone for a week. This exercise is designed to prompt greater awareness of which types of phone activities consume the most energy and reflection on the relationships between user behaviour, design choices and social processes (such as the desire to be part of an ‘always on’ society).\nThe Battery Game - teachers’ instructions and sample reflections from students in the 2023/4 cohort\nData Environmentalism (University of Southampton) # This second year elective module (that is, it can be taken by any Humanities student) run by James Baker draws on scholarship from digital media studies, environmental history, computer science, science and technology studies, climate science, creative practice, and archival science, to examine the past, present, and future intersections of data and the natural environment. It starts with some simple statements - that data is material, is produced by people, is made possible by resource extraction, needs power to survive, and inhabits and resculpts the landscape - before expanding out into a range of topics (TESCREALism and the \u0026lsquo;Californian Ideology\u0026rsquo;, the sacking of Timnit Gebru, pollution as a form of colonialism, energy (dis)proportionality) that encourage humanities students use their skills and perspectives to illuminate and challenge the ecological impacts of computational technologies.\nThe module ran for the first time in 2022/23. The latest reading list is available here. A few reflections from James:\nThree things stand out from my experience of teaching Data Environmentalism. First, students - in the main - really cared, really wanted to know more, and enjoyed the challenge of working in a multi-disciplinary space. Second, they loved the week hooked around Crawford and Joler\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Anatomy of an Amazon Echo\u0026rdquo;: I printed a huge copy for us to pour over in class, and that proved really generative. Third, it was extra work, but making the assessment activist focused - a \u0026lsquo;public outcome\u0026rsquo; and a reflexive essay on producing the public outcome - was a big win, as it enabled the students to express their interests/fear/anger in forms that they felt had the potential to change things - such as a film on greenwashing in the tech sector or a magazine on NTFs.\nResources # This section could use your input.

The trust runs a wide variety of workshops, classes, events and exhibitions, welcomes over 15,000 children every year to its immersive education programme, and runs projects with individuals, groups and communities that would otherwise not have access to culture. In addition, the trust cares for 2.5 million objects relating to Hampshire’s rich history. It employs around 140 staff and has over 400 volunteers. HCT has made a concerted effort to better understand and improve its environmental impact since 2019. Rolling, detailed action plans for the next 12 months have been developed, and a dedicated project team has been set up – 12-14 people from across the organisation, all of whom dedicate half a day per week to HCT’s environmental action. With the support of a small HEIF grant via the University of Sussex, we — Josephine Lethbridge and Jo Lindsay Walton, with support from other DHCC members — were able to engage with HCT in 2023 to find out about their approach to decarbonisation and to offer support. This support included bringing in the carbon accounting platform Greenly (see below) as a project partner.\nPrior to this project, HCT had carried out a biodiversity opportunity review and buildings-level analysis for scope 1 and 2 emissions. (Scope 1 refers to direct emissions, e.g. vehicles, burning fuel on site, and scope 2 refers mostly to indirect emissions from buying electricity and heating/cooling). Based on this analysis and in partnership with the local council, HCT had also installed a total of 654 photovoltaic solar panels across four of its sites. In June 2022, HCT was given bronze accreditation from the Carbon Literacy Project and became the first museum organisation in the UK’s south to achieve Carbon Literate Organisation status.\nWhen our project began, the trust’s main ambitions were to:\nFurther develop action plans so as to achieve its commitment to reach net zero by 2030 (scopes 1 \u0026amp; 2) as well as reducing scope 3; Engage internal and external stakeholders around the severity of the climate crisis and the need for action. HCT’s immediate ambitions, and reasons for getting involved in this project, were to carry out deeper analysis of its carbon impact, and include those learnings in the next version of its environmental action plan. As a charity, HCT does not have funds readily available to enact the costlier elements of this plan. Over the next year, the organisation has ambitions to raise £100,000 in funding to dedicate to its sustainability trajectory.\nHCT’s key challenges, we heard at the outset of the process, included:\n1. Accessing expertise\nComprehensively calculating carbon emissions, and devising a plan for reducing them, are complex tasks requiring specialist skills and knowledge. 2. Prioritising and coordinating action\nOf course, many decarbonisation actions can be taken even without comprehensive emissions data. However, without such data it is difficult to:\nknow what to prioritise, ensure that teams across the organisation understand and feel invested in sustainability, persuade senior management to commit finance and other resources, and ensure a coordinated, evidence-based approach to new sustainability initiatives or projects. 3. Mobilising staff time and other resources to deliver\nWith staff often juggling many duties, it has sometimes been hard to get buy-in on sustainability initiatives. Staff may feel that sustainability is not really part of their job description. In the case of the HCT-Greenly engagement, however, there was dedicated staff time to compile and prepare the data for Greenly’s analysis.\nGreenly # To make timely progress toward net zero, all sectors need to decarbonise. But organisations come in many sizes and shapes. Some may have in-house expertise to do their own carbon accounting, or have resources to invest in climate consultants — but a great many don’t. Greenly is one of many fast-growing tech companies that position themselves as a tech solution to the time-consuming and complex tasks of carbon accounting and the creation of carbon management plans. There is some overlap between what Greenly does and climate consulting, except that ‘climate consulting’ tends to refer to more expensive, bespoke engagements, whereas Greenly wants to offer a relatively more accessible package. Companies operating in a similar space might include Watershed, Sweep, Plan A, Persefoni and Normative.\nFounded in France in 2019, Greenly has more recently expanded into the US and UK. At the time of writing, Greenly has c. 170 staff and over 1500 clients. The bulk are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), though they are increasingly working with bigger clients. Greenly offers its clients annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reports, support from its climate experts (i.e. carbon accounting and management experts), and automated carbon reduction suggestions through its platform.\nGreenly calculate carbon footprints using a hybrid approach of spend-based and activity-based assessment. Spend-based assessment is relatively quick and easy to do. The amount a company spends across various categories is multiplied by numbers (Emissions Factors) representing typical GHG emissions associated with that type of spend, to get a rough idea of emissions. Activity-based assessment is much more detailed, and can require very complex data collection and analysis, but can be much more accurate. Greenly emphasise that carbon accounting should support actions to decarbonise, not become an end in itself. The flexible mix of spend- and activity-based assessment is a way of doing this while also keeping costs down.\nAs well as the core carbon accounting offering, clients can also use the Greenly platform to engage employees and suppliers in the company’s climate journey, purchase carbon offsets, and/or work towards receiving the Greenly Net Zero Contributor certification (achieving this is reliant on paying Greenly to co-develop or audit these plans). They can also access some resources, such as slide decks, to help with communicating around decarbonisation and net zero.\nAdditional support from Greenly’s climate experts, for example providing deep-dive analysis into a particular portion of an organisation’s emissions, or in putting together a decarbonisation strategy, is also available for purchase. Further services are available through the Climate App Store section of the Greenly platform. This offers a wide range of tailored carbon calculators, from basic calculators which are free to use, to sector-specific paid-for ‘premium’ apps such as the cloud app, which integrates with cloud service provider APIs to measure carbon emissions based on hourly electricity map data. Similar premium apps are also available for websites, events, freight, menus and construction site carbon calculators, amongst others.\nHCT was a slightly atypical client for Greenly, and part of the appeal of the project for Greenly was the chance to try out its tools and expertise in a new context. At the same time, expanding to serve new types of clients is very much part of Greenly’s model. Greenly aims to eventually create a platform that is near 100% automated, by learning from each client and building those learnings into the platform, so that next time a similar client comes along, they don’t need nearly as much face-to-face help.\nOutcomes # The HCT team was thrilled at the level of granularity available in the emissions data, and the variety of charts and views available. One team member told us: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re all a bit rabbit in the headlights at how brilliant it all is … It probably would have taken us a few years to get to this place.\u0026rdquo;\nOverall, the spread of emissions over different aspects of HCT’s operations, and what this implied about main areas to focus on, tallied with HCT’s expectations, apart from some surprise at the scale of emissions deriving from service and product purchase.\nThe main benefit of the analysis was seen to be its potential in lending clarity and gravitas to the team’s existing plans. One told us: \u0026ldquo;We were really stuck. Some people want to see data and figures and proof backing up suggested approaches and action plans. So Greenly has really helped with that.\u0026rdquo; Another said: \u0026ldquo;Just having the data is fantastic. There\u0026rsquo;s going to be so many ways we can use it – in funding applications, fighting our case and trying to push things through with the council, and internally as well, being able to get people on board\u0026rdquo;.\nWe asked how the engagement could be further improved. HCT suggested they would be keen on more advice and support on using the data internally. This might also have included more active encouragement from the Greenly side for senior staff to engage, particularly for the final presentation, and to involve more staff from across the organisation in data collection.\nGreenly were transparent about various assumptions, estimates and compromises which needed to be made along the way. “We were able to observe how such decisions, while made for good pragmatic reasons, tended to grow less visible over time. While this didn’t especially worry the HCT team, we wonder whether just a hint more acknowledgement of the estimated nature of the assessment could go a long way in terms of developing clients’ understanding of the nature of their emissions, and inform more robust measurement and action in the future.” For more on the relationship of uncertainty data and climate decision-making, see Communicating Climate Risk: A Toolkit.\nAs HCT mentioned internal comms as a topic of special interest, we also invited Climate Action Unit (CAU) to share their perspectives. We were joined by Freya Roberts for a wide-ranging discussion. One key principle which emerged was the importance of two-way dialogue: that individuals should get the space and support to express whatever challenges they face in taking action.\nFuture directions # At time of writing, we are working on refining our recommendations for project partners. We hope to continue to work with both HCT and Greenly, and have recently sought follow-on funding (AHRC IAA and AHRC Net Zero Design Accelerator) to support this work. On the Greenly side, we see potential for expanding resources to support clients in using data internally and externally, opportunities around quantifying and visualising uncertainty, as well as localising decarbonisation recommendation resources, and transforming approaches to carbon offsetting. On the HCT side, we are exploring the possibility of delivering workshops for internal and/or external audiences to expand the opportunities for dialogue on decarbonisation.\nIf the ambition to automate carbon accounting is realistic – if Greenly are going to be able to make the process seamless and intelligible for their clients, and create GHG assessments that are accurate enough for those clients to develop comprehensive, tailored action plans – then the potential benefits could indeed be enormous. One presumes that costs might be so reduced that the carbon accounting platform would become accessible to organisations in the cultural sector that have traditionally struggled to raise any funds for this kind of work.\nThere are also potential policy implications. One expert we interviewed as part of our background research, who is a Managing Director of a Sustainability Consultancy in Southeast Asia, commented, \u0026ldquo;If platform services reduce the cost of decarbonisation for SMEs, then I can see that being a huge piece of the puzzle that\u0026rsquo;s missing. It would actually help the regulators roll out wider requirements on disclosure and perhaps even reduction. They\u0026rsquo;re very reluctant to do that right now due to high costs and perceived difficulty\u0026rdquo;.\nThe tech platform approach to carbon management is relatively new, and approaches are evolving rapidly. It is crucial that its evolution is shaped by all stakeholders, including interdisciplinary academic expertise. The use of automation indicates a clear role for disciplines and fields such as the digital humanities, critical data studies, AI ethics, and political ecology, as well as many different climate-related fields within the social and physical sciences.\nGiven that the main beneficiaries of the platform-based approach to carbon management include SMEs, NGOs or cultural organisations that those that don’t have the finances available for more expensive, sector-specific consultants, it’s crucial to consider how such platforms can better serve the specific needs of those organisations in the context of the overall aim of a just transition. The design of automated systems is seldom value-neutral, and we see collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches as the best way to ensure reflection and conversation around these issues.\nIt is also key to keep an open mind about the future. From what we have observed here, it is still difficult to say exactly how existing carbon accounting approaches would fit into the bigger social and economic shifts implied by most moderately positive vision of the future. Bold policy changes, and/or social, cultural and economic shifts, may transform the assumptions on which such engagements have operated to date.\n### Digital Carbon ### The activity-based analysis that Greenly conducted around emissions related to HCT’s IT emissions were limited to the 2022 purchase of items in its IT inventory. As only a very small proportion of HCT’s emissions are related to IT usage, this was deemed to be more than enough detail. Greenly also offers (for an extra price) the use of its Green IT module. This enables companies to more accurately assess the emissions of their IT by collating an inventory of tech/terminals, measuring emissions related to data storage, adverts and web content. Purchase of this module is recommended for any company with a large proportion of IT-related emissions (at least \u003c5%). How Greenly calculates cloud-related emissions for such clients may be of particular interest to readers of this case study. The major cloud providers are Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), and Alphabet/Google (GCP). The methodologies used by these companies to provide emissions data has been widely criticised. The three cloud giants’ overall role within climate transition is complicated, and impressive-looking climate strategies turn out to be very heavily based on offsetting and somewhat risky bets on future technological innovation. See e.g. Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor for more details. ![Electricity Maps](./images/electricity-maps.png) For cloud users who would prefer to get their emissions data from a different source, Greenly offers a more accurate estimation of the emissions tied to the actual energy their cloud providers have purchased through the grid. The module integrates information about the amount of data a company stores and processes, which cloud providers they use, the type of processors those providers use, the energy efficiency of those processors, the locations of the data centres, and so on. Time-sensitive data around energy usage, cloud provider and server location on the one hand is paired with real-time geographically-based information about the make-up of the local energy grid on the other. This produces more accurate estimations of the actual emissions caused by the powering of a company’s cloud infrastructure. When calculated on this level of granularity, Greenly is confident that up to 55% of cloud-based emissions can be cut without any reduction in demand. This, they argue, can be achieved through changing to a more efficient cloud provider; moving data storage somewhere with a better energy mix (e.g. Scandinavia); and planning data transfers/processing to occur at low/off-peak hours. For the HCT case study, however, this was not seen as a priority and so was not included in the engagement. Case Study 2: DH Benelux Workshop # The action-items on the group Jamboard after the workshop finished (31 May 2022)\n2.1 Description # James Baker, Lisa Otty, Christopher Ohge et al. 2022\nThis was a workshop run in 2022 with DH researchers as the primary audience. We underscored how as arts and humanities researchers it is our role to probe the values, the power structures, and the future imaginaries that underpin sustainable digital solutions. Moreover, given the immense and monopolistic power wielded by the global tech sector, and the critiques of this power that are part of the Digital Humanities, this community is well positioned to create change and demonstrate to our colleagues and collaborators how change can happen. Our use of technology and infrastructure should be informed by the ways corporate economic, cultural, and scientific power perpetuates and exacerbates the crisis. Choosing a hardware or hosting provider, for example, should mean considering direct environmental impacts, broader environmental policies and record of the provider, and more broadly still, the kinds of collective future that such a collaborative encounter presupposes. We should be able to candidly explore the complex and sometimes contradictory nature of our ecological impact: we should be able to measure and model where possible, while also creating context around our measurements, flagging uncertainties, and advocating for transforming wider conditions.\n2.2 Themes # decarbonising our research and teaching, working at the intersection of humanities and digital technology to understand the role of data science in climate transition and climate justice, transforming DH (and knowledge institutions) within broader transformations of society. 2.3 Notes # Access the workshop notes on this Etherpad Document.\n2.4 Structure # Introductions. Refining questions, challenges, opportunities (40 mins)\nFirst, facilitated brainstorming and rapid co-production will refine questions, challenges, and opportunities around climate change and the digital humanities that are relevant in your local contexts. This part of the workshop will draw on the workshop model developed for the November 2021 “Greening DH summit”. This model balances the knowledge that time is fleeting and there is an impetus to act, with an awareness that participants will have variable expertise regarding the climate crisis, the energy/resource costs of digital technologies, and ‘green computing’ practices.\nAccess the slides.\n10 minute break\nGreening DH Toolkit (50 minutes)\nSecond, participants will be asked to respond to sections of the DHCC’s work-in-progress Greening DH Toolkit. Specifically, participants will work in small groups to evaluate prototype sections of the toolkit, and to design their own implementation strategies for these sections. In keeping with the “RE-MIX” theme of the conference, we will discuss how agencies, funding bodies, and institutions in the Benelux region can be leveraged to enable implementation, as well as the barriers they might create.\nIntroduction to the Tool-kit and how it is structured [5–10 min] Engaging with the tool-kit Participants to examine a section of the tool-kit that speaks to their needs and interests [20 min] Formulate responses–questions or provocations or suggest edits\u0026ndash;and discuss as a group [25 min] 10 minute break\nCommitments (up to 60 minutes)\nThird, participants will be asked to vocalise their next steps, the commitments they make to their future DH work, so as to create both an individual and collective impetus to act. Participants who would like to continue to collaborate on the Toolkit after the workshop will be invited to join the DHCC Toolkit Action Group.\nHow can we translate what we discussed into concrete next steps? Possible next steps inspired by an earlier DHCC workshop and maybe H4F workshops [10 min] Ask participants what commitments they can make for the next week, month, year, collect those commitments on Jamboard and discuss [20-25 min] Pick a commitment and ecard and schedule the card to be sent in a week/month/year as a reminder Case Study 3: Sussex Digital Humanities Lab Servers # Nicolas Seymour-Smith, February 2024\n3.1 Context # SHL Digital is a multi-disciplinary digital humanities lab that relies on digital infrastructure to support research and collaboration. In many cases these infrastructure requirements cannot be met by running software on personal computers, e.g. because the computational processing power required is too high, or the hosted service requires a permanent online presence.\nTo meet these needs so far, the SHL Digital has been relying on its own servers and staff to provide researchers with a platform to run their software. This platform can manage most computational tasks (short of machine-learning applications that require high amounts of GPU power), and can run any custom software that runs on the Linux operating system. In late 2023 and early 2024 we carried out a review, including estimates of carbon impacts.\n3.2 Hardware and basic CO2 estimates # SHL Digital servers are three high-power computers which were bought together in 2018. These were fairly standard commercial servers for the time, and Dell provides their own estimates of the CO2 impact of these servers based on a 4 year life span:\nTwo Dell Poweredge R440 servers, 2x7360 kg CO2, 2x1155 kg of which is carbon produced in manufacturing, and the majority of the rest is from estimated computational usage One Dell Poweredge R740xd server, 9180 kg CO2, 1321 kg of which is carbon produced in manufacturing, and the majority of the rest is from estimated computational usage From Dell’s carbon footprint reports: \u0026ldquo;Dell uses PAIA (Product Attribute to Impact Algorithm) to perform product carbon footprints. PAIA is a streamlined LCA tool developed by MITs Materials System Laboratory. It takes into consideration important attributes of the product which can be correlated to activities in order to calculate the product carbon footprint.\u0026rdquo;\nHowever none of their documentation explains what level of usage is assumed in making these estimates.\n3.3 Improving usage estimates # Given that it’s possible for us to monitor the CPU usage of our servers, and the number of visitors to our websites, we can make an adjustment to Dell’s estimates, by substituting an impact based on our real usage.\nThe DHCC Toolkit provides links to resources for calculating carbon impact of computation in a few different contexts. The most relevant for us are:\nGreen Algorithms for estimating CO2 impact based on various relevant properties of the server including the ’real usage factor’ of the CPU, and CO2.js, which can help us calculate the emissions associated with the number of bytes transmitted from our websites to visitors across internet infrastructure that has its own CO2 impact. 3.4 Monitoring real computational usage # Plenty of tools and services exist for aggregating CPU usage over long periods. netdata.cloud provides one such free tool that is very simple to install on all platforms and provides a simple web based user interface that can be accessed either locally or through the netdata.cloud website.\nUsing this tool to monitor the CPU load of our servers for 2 weeks, we got average values of 7.65%, and 1% for our R440 servers, and 1% for our R750xd server. Entering this and other relevant details into http://calculator.green-algorithms.org/, we got 945g and 891g of CO2 per day for our R440s and 450g for our R750xd server.\nIt’s interesting to note that while our CPU usage is low on both our R440s, it is significantly lower on our second unit, and yet the CO2 calculation is not far different. This implies that at low usage numbers at least, base power usage could be dominating the CO2 output. Further, while the R750xd has similar usage to one of our R440s, the CO2 impact came out roughly half. Given that this unit has half as much memory, perhaps a lot of that base power usage is going into memory use. We could spend some time delving into the details of the calculator to learn more.\nAll told, the total CO2 impact based on ’real usage’ of processing power is estimated at 2.3 kg/day or 834 kg/year.\n3.5 Monitoring real data transmission # It’s also possible to get the total data transmission values from the netdata.cloud service, but it’s a little more difficult to coax out the value as a total rather than a rate, and so instead I used a separate tool called goaccess. There’s a handy tutorial for setting this up for long term monitoring here.\nThis provided a monthly data transmission value of 4 GB over a period of a month. A handy tutorial for using CO2.js to calculate CO2 impact from this number can be found here.\nThis calculation gave us a value of 1.4 kg/month, or 17kg/year. There’s a possibility that adding this value to the 834 kg/year from computational usage involves some double-counting. We’d have to look into the algorithm that co2.js is using to work out the breakdown of CO2 impact in terms of internet infrastructure and computational power to work out how much, if any.\n3.6 Our improved estimate # We can now add the manufacturing impact documented in Dell’s documentation to our ’real’ estimates of computational and transmission impacts to get a potentially improved estimate:\nManufacturing: 3632 kg Real CPU: 834 kg/year Real data transmission: 17 kg/year Taking the same lifespan assumption as the Dell documentation (4 years): that gives us an overall impact of 7036 kg, which is a third of Dell’s 23900 kg estimate based on an unknown usage factor.\nGiven our very low usage statistics and the disparity with the Dell estimate, we might assume that the majority of our CO2 impact comes from basic power requirements of the idle system.\n3.7 Conclusion # This work was undertaken as part of a broader analysis of SHL Digital\u0026rsquo;s resources and needs, in order to plan for efficient provision of these services in the future. This analysis allowed us to weigh sustainability as a factor into those plans. From this perspective, we can ask the following questions:\nCould downsizing our server infrastructure to more closely match our real-terms usage and traffic reduce our carbon impact (by reducing manufacturing related CO2 and basic power requirements) without running us into issues of procesing power? At first glance this seems likely. Whether downsizing could also be accompanied by migration to externally hosted and or shared services could be an interesting follow on. Case Study 4: Congruence Engine - raising environmental awareness in an interdisciplinary research project # Natasha Kitcher, Max Long, and Anna-Maria Sichani, January 2025\nOverview # Congruence Engine was a digital humanities project which ran between late 2021 and early 2025. Combining the expertise of museum curators, academic historians, and data scientists, the project explored new ways of linking industrial heritage, focussing on three key strands at the heart of UK industrial history: energy, communications, and textiles. Congruence Engine was based at the Science Museum in London, and involved the collaboration of more than two dozen partner organisations from across the UK.\nWe were one of five projects funded by the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), as part of its Towards a National Collection (TaNC) funding stream. The TaNC programme explored opportunities for the development of a ‘UK digital collection’ by forging links between heritage items and expanding access to the nation’s collections.\nAlthough UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the AHRC have made substantial infrastructure investments to achieve carbon-neutral computing by 2040, the TaNC programme did not develop a shared environmental impact strategy across the projects that it funded. It was not until the final year of the project that we were able to take the time to reflect on our own environmental impact as a project and what that might mean for future recommendations for the development of collections-linking digital infrastructure. We also wanted to explore how the Science Museum Group\u0026rsquo;s own approach to environmental ethics, including their decision to accept corporate sponsorship from major energy corporations such as Adani, might affect our own positionality as individual researchers and as a collective (see the SMG sustainability approach, and blogs (1) and (2) on the topic).\nOur approach # The decentralised and experimental nature of the project, with over 40 investigations taking place simultaneously made it difficult to establish a united approach to environmental ethics. This was also complicated by the interdisciplinary composition of the team, which included museum curators, academic researchers, data and computer scientists, and administrative and managerial staff. The team included individuals employed directly by the Science Museum, as well as collaborators spread across partner institutions. Each team member arrived with a different set of personal priorities and expectations, and technical expertise, as well as being bound by a range of institutional working practices and policies.\nOver the course of the project there were sporadic and ongoing discussions about the environmental and social impacts of digital research, and particularly of computationally intensive tasks involving machine learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs). In the last year of the project we established an environmental impact working group, led by Natasha Kitcher, Max Long, Anna-Maria Sichani, and Kunika Kono.\nThis work was kick-started by Kunika Kono’s decision to investigate her own electricity usage during the project. Kunika used a single board computer to run typical tasks involved in her Congruence Engine work, and recorded the electricity required to perform these tasks using a USB-ammeter (a device for measuring the electrical current in a circuit). The group considered if it would be possible to scale this up for the project as a whole, asking each team member to calculate their usage for a day. The aim of this approach would have been to provide tangible insights into the energy demands of the project’s daily computational activities and to promote greater awareness of the environmental impact associated with their work. But, after investigating a range of hardware and software options, we decided that it would not be feasible to undertake this kind of assessment. We realised that measuring local consumption by a representative sample of the team using an ammeter presented technical challenges, particularly in isolating the consumption associated with individual tasks. Moreover, we were conscious of the fact that some of our largest environmental costs were likely associated with cloud services and other external providers. While numerous tools are available to measure these impacts, their value is principally in awareness-raising, and we found they would not enable us to accurately understand our use of LLMs.\nInstead, we focussed our energies on building a collective awareness of the environmental impact of digital research across the project team. Our approach comprised a set of targeted actions:\nWe established a Zotero group library on the environmental impacts of computationally intensive research. This has been mainly used as an initial starting point for our own research and work and gradually developed to a dynamic reference point for the entire project team. The library currently contains 71 resources and is now open to the wider cultural heritage community as a work-in-progress - please feel free to join and add your resources too!\nWe ran a qualitative survey to assess our team’s working practices from an environmental point of view, including research and administrative staff.\nTwo members of the team participated in a two-day Carbon Literacy training organized by the Heritage Trust Network for cultural heritage professionals and researchers.\nWe held a workshop for members of the project around environmental ethics in research. This workshop was a great opportunity for us to collectively reflect on the environmental impacts of our research practices, and to share and discuss the results of the survey. Learnings from our Carbon Literacy training course were also shared with the wider team.\nOutcomes on github # A full write-up of the impact of our work, including results from our internal survey and details about the workshop, is available to view on the DHCC github.\nCase studies elsewhere # Low-carbon websites\n","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"dhcc-case-studies\"\u003e\n  DHCC Case Studies\n  \u003ca class=\"anchor\" href=\"#dhcc-case-studies\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"book-hint warning\"\u003e\n  \nThe first two case studies in what we hope will be a growing library.\n\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"Hampshire-Cultural-Trust\"\u003e\n  Case Study 1: Hampshire Cultural Trust and Greenly\n  \u003ca class=\"anchor\" href=\"#Hampshire-Cultural-Trust\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJosephine Lethbridge and Jo Lindsay Walton, November 2023\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"book-hint info\"\u003e\n  \n\u003ch3\u003e Highlights \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e GLAM sector organisations face many challenges in decarbonisation, including need for financial support to decarbonise, and expertise in carbon accounting and management planning.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e Carbon accounting and management support needs to be offered accessibly and at scale, and there is a role for automated approaches to help this happen.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e Interdisciplinary academic expertise, including fields like the digital humanities, AI ethics, critical data studies, and political ecology, can usefully inform the further development of carbon accounting platforms and tools.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.hampshireculture.org.uk/\"\u003eHampshire Cultural Trust\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e (HCT) is an independent charity that manages and supports visitor attractions, museums, art galleries and arts centres across the UK county of Hampshire.

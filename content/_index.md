<h2> The Digital Humanities Climate Coalition Toolkit</h2>

This toolkit is a guide to making your research practices more environmentally responsible. It is geared towards digital practices, but also touches on general areas such as travel and advocacy. We hope it will be relevant to researchers, educators, students, administrators, librarians, technicians, and others. The toolkit aims to highlight actionable solutions, while also critically reflecting on their nuances, in the broader context of climate justice. It is a community-developed work-in-progress, and you are warmly invited to contribute.

<h2> Digital Humanities and the Climate Crisis: A Manifesto</h2>

<a href="https://dhc-barnard.github.io/envdh/">Digital Humanities and the Climate Crisis: A Manifesto</a>. "The digital is material. As digital humanists, every project we create, every software application we use, every piece of hardware we purchase impacts our environment. [...] As humanities researchers, it is also our role to probe the values, the power structures, and the future imaginaries that underpin sustainable solutions."

<h2> Workshops and Talks</h2>

Members of the DHCC have given talks and workshops related to this toolkit in various contexts including <a href="https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/case-studies.html">DH Benelux</a>, the Norwegian Technical University, the British Library, National Library of Scotland, the Canadian Health Libraries Association, and the National Archives.

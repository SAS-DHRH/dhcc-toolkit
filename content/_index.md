## DH Benelux 2022 Workshop (Luxembourg)

The DHCC hosted an afternoon workshop on 31 May 2022 for the DH Benelux workshop.

Themes: \
(a) decarbonising our research and teaching,\
(b) working at the intersection of humanities and digital technology to understand the role of data science in climate transition and climate justice,\
(c) transforming DH (and knowledge institutions) within broader transformations of society.

### A Manifesto

[Digital Humanities and the Climate Crisis](https://dhc-barnard.github.io/envdh/)

“The digital is material. As digital humanists, every project we create, every software application we use, every piece of hardware we purchase impacts our environment. [...] As humanities researchers, it is also our role to probe the values, the power structures, and the future imaginaries that underpin sustainable solutions.”

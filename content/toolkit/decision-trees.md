# Decision trees

{{< hint warning >}}We hope to include some visual decision support tools in this section in the future. These might draw especially on the evidence and recommendations in the Working Practices and Project Planning sections. If you're interested in contributing to this section, please get in touch, or [join the conversation here](https://github.com/SAS-DHRH/dhcc-toolkit/issues/35).

Our first step below is to build a list of needs, and to signpost relevant evidence and recommendations within the toolkit.

{{</ hint >}}

**I am organising an online event**

* If you are delivering the event as part of a funded project, make sure you include environmental considerations in your application. See [Grant Writing](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/grant-writing.html) for more details. 
* See section on [Communication Methods](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/working-practices.html#communication-methods) for more information on videoconferencing.
* Consider what other computing processes will be involved in running your event. These may include:
  * Creating a website. See [Minimal Computing](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html), and in particular, sections on [Static Site Generators](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#static-site-generators), [Tips for Sustainable Websites](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#tips) and [Critical Design and Systems Change](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#system-change). 
  * Emailing. See [Day-to-day Working and Data Traffic](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/working-practices.html#day-to-day-working-and-data-traffic). 
  * Lastly, you should consider how you will responsibly dispose of project websites, email threads etc., and how you will archive your data. See [Archiving Your Data](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/working-practices.html#archiving-your-data).

**I am organising a hybrid event**

* Organising a hybrid event will involve many of the same questions as organising an online event. See above for relevant links. 
* Additionally, you should consider:
  * [Travel](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/working-practices.html#travel) 
  * [Catering](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/working-practices.html#catering-events) 
* You may also want to consider the bigger picture of your institution’s [energy procurement](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/advocating-within-your-institution.html#energy-procurement) strategy. 

**I want to create a website for a research project**

* Begin by factoring consideration of website creation and maintenance in your project proposal’s data management plan. See discussion of [Energy Proportionality](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/grant-writing.html#DMP) in the Grant Writing section for more details. 
* When it comes to designing your website, you could consider factors such as [Static Versus Dynamic Websites](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#static-v-dynamic), [Tips for Sustainable Websites](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#tips) and [Critical Design and Systems Change](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#system-change).
* Additional guidance on [Minimal Computing Principles](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#minicomp-principles) may also be helpful for approaches for sustainable website design. 
* Think about where to [host your website.](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#hosting)
* After the conclusion of the research project, it is important to consider how you will dispose of and [archive your data](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/working-practices.html#archiving-your-data). 

**I want to create a digital edition of a book**

* Consider what would be the least energy intensive way to produce a digital edition of a book. It is likely that you can publish a transcribed manuscript or a collection of images on a static website. For details on this, see [Static versus Dynamic Websites](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#static-v-dynamic). 
* Other considerations include:
  * [Images](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#images)
  * [Fonts](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#fonts)
  * [Hosting](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#hosting) your digital edition with a green hosting provider.

**I want to create a personal website**

* First, consider the purpose of this website. Do you want to share blog posts, display images or include interactivity features such as comments? Use these questions to decide what kind of website is the most appropriate for your needs. For more details on this, see [Static Versus Dynamic Webistes](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#static-v-dynamic). 
* If you require a dynamic website, the section on [Content Management Systems](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#content-management-systems) includes links to tools for creating more lightweight dynamic websites. 
* The section on [Tips for Sustainable Website Design](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#tips) includes a number of further useful tips, including advice on images, fonts, hosting considerations and more.

**I want to create a website for a research network**

* First, consider the purpose of this website. Do you want to share blog posts, display images or include interactivity features such as comments? Next you can decide what kind of website is the most appropriate for your needs. For more details on this, see [Static Versus Dynamic Webistes](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#static-v-dynamic). If you require a dynamic website, the section on [Content Management Systems](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#content-management-systems) includes links to tools for creating more lightweight dynamic websites. 
* Additionally, the section on [Tips for Sustainable Website Design](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#tips) includes useful information about images, fonts, hosting considerations and more.
* Lastly, you should consider how you will [Archive Your Data](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/working-practices.html#archiving-your-data).

**I want to train an AI**
* The section on [Maximal Computing](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/maximal-computing.html) provides information on computationally intensive work. In particular, see discussion of [Energy Proportionality](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/maximal-computing.html#problems-of-proportionality), which will help you to consider your rationale for training an AI; and [Measures of Efficiency](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/maximal-computing.html#measures-of-efficiency), which provides information on using more energy efficient models. 
* The section on [Easy Wins](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/maximal-computing.html#some-easy-wins) contains advice on training models for machine learning tasks.
* Additionally, consider the carbon cost of AI in your project’s [Data Management Plan](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/grant-writing.html#DMP).

**I want to build a recommendations engine**
* The section on [Maximal Computing](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/maximal-computing.html) provides information on computationally intensive work. In particular, see sections on [Energy Proportionality](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/maximal-computing.html#problems-of-proportionality), which will help you to consider your rationale for building a recommendations engine, and [Measures of Efficiency](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/maximal-computing.html#measures-of-efficiency), which provides information on using more energy efficient models.

* Additionally, consider your use of a recommendations engine in your project’s [Data Management Plan](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/grant-writing.html#DMP).

**I am writing a Data Management Plan**

See section on [Grant Writing](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/grant-writing.html#grant-writing) and [Data Management Plans](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/grant-writing.html#DMP) for specific advice on energy proportionality, identifying relevant standards and frameworks, and more.

**I think my laptop / desktop / device needs replacing**

* The section on [Using Digital Devices in General in ‘Working Practices’](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/working-practices.html#using-digital-devices-in-general) has useful information on the carbon cost of hardware and how to replace hardware in an environmentally responsible manner.
* This could also be an opportunity for [Advocating within your Institution](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/advocating-within-your-institution.html#advocating-within-your-institution) for more systemic change. 
* You might see replacing your work computer in a sustainable way as a [small change](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/advocating-within-your-institution.html#institutional-legitimacy), but you can [Connect Small Changes with Big Changes](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/advocating-within-your-institution.html#connect-small-changes-and-big-changes) in order to improve institutional practices more generally. 

**I am requesting equipment for my DH lab**

* The section on [Using Digital Devices in General in ‘Working Practices’](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/working-practices.html#using-digital-devices-in-general) has useful information on the carbon cost of hardware and how to replace hardware in an environmentally responsible manner.
* Additionally, requesting lab equipment provides an opportunity for [Advocating within your Institution](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/advocating-within-your-institution.html#advocating-within-your-institution). In particular, see sections on how to [Get Involved in Supply Decisions](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/advocating-within-your-institution.html#supply-decisions) and a list of [Questions](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/advocating-within-your-institution.html#ask-questions) to ask senior decision-makers at your institution.

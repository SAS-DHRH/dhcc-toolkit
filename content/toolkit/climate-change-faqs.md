# Climate Change FAQs

## 1. How does climate change work? ## 

Carbon and other greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere (especially from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal). Some emissions are then safely removed again (e.g. absorbed by trees), but some hang around in the atmosphere. This traps the sun's energy in our planetary climate, causing average planetary temperatures to rise (called global warming or global heating). The consequences already include wildfires, droughts, loss of soil moisture, famines, disease, heatwaves, loss of arctic ice and rising sea levels, ocean acidification, storms, floods, wildlife extinction, and more.

## 2. What are we doing about climate change? ## 

Climate action is usually divided into **adaptation** and **mitigation**. Adaptation means doing things to prepare for a hotter climate, such as investing in resilient agriculture, relocating coastal communities, hardening infrastructure, building flood defences, etc. Reducing poverty and inequality has been shown to improve resilience to climate impacts. Mitigation is about doing things to slow and eventually halt global warming. Mitigation includes reducing emissions (by switching from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind) and also increasing the planet's absorptive capacity (reforestation, wetland preservation, restorative agriculture, carbon removal technologies, etc.). **Climate justice** is also important to mention here. Climate action is seldom uniform in its impacts: one group's adaptation may be another group's maladaptation. Climate transition finance is currently severely skewed to the Global North, even though countries in the Global South tend to be on the frontlines of climate impacts, *and* the least responsible for climate change, in terms of historic emissions levels.

## 3. How much time is left? ## 

It depends. Not long ago, the conversation around climate change revolved around the question, "When will we start to take serious action?" That has now changed.

Now the questions are about implementation ("How are we taking action?") and justice ("Which 'we' is taking action?"). At the Paris Agreement in 2015, world leaders agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. To have a decent shot at this means the world needs to peak net global carbon emissions immediately (2025 by the very latest), approximately halve net emissions by 2030, and get to net zero by 2050.

[This 2022 article](https://www.ft.com/content/7e047a60-c2eb-47ed-b6bf-fff4260079c9) by Anjana Ahuja contains some interesting perspectives on climate messaging, and how precise deadline framing might sometimes be counterproductive.

Climate action *is* already happening; it's not happening fast enough; there are tangible benefits to doing things sooner rather than later, and doing them decisively rather than half-heartedly.

## 4. How does ICT contribute to climate change? ## 

Information technology requires energy, and much of this energy is currently being generated by burning fossil fuels. Globally, Information Communication Technology (ICT) contributes 1.8% to 3.9% of greenhouse gas emissions [(Freitag et al. 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100340).

Digital technology has other impacts on the environment. For example, rare minerals are required in the manufacture of hardware. Mining resources such as coltan (for tantalum) and gold is bound up with exploitation and conflict. Disposal of devices and components is also a huge issue. E-waste volumes are vast and growing, and can contribute to climate change (directly, e.g. through greenhouse gas refrigerants, and indirectly, e.g. through missed opportunities for low carbon manufacturing based on reclaimed materials), and can release toxins and other hazardous substances.

## 5. What is net zero? ## 

Net zero refers to a situation in which carbon emissions are balanced by carbon removals. Once the world as a whole achieves net zero, the latest science suggests that average global temperature will no longer rise. Net zero is also a target at other scales, e.g. country, city, institution, individual, event, product. There are [worthwhile criticisms](https://theconversation.com/climate-scientists-concept-of-net-zero-is-a-dangerous-trap-157368) of the net zero paradigm (and other terms including **real zero**, **absolute zero**, and **net negative** have been suggested as complementary / alternative rallying points); however, net zero is by far the dominant paradigm of current policymaking and strategy.

## 6. But environmental sustainability is about more than just climate change, right? ## 

That's right. For example, biodiversity loss, land-system change, altered biogeochemical cycles (phosphorus and nitrogen), and other [planetary boundaries](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html). This toolkit emphasises climate change, but these issues are all interconnected. 

## 7. How should we talk to students, colleagues and other people about climate change? ##

Climate change communication is a huge field. Three insights are worth bearing in mind.

- Mix in _positivity and hope_. Getting bombarded with the scale and complexity of the challenges can be disempowering and counterproductive.
- Try to find _models for action_. In other words (even setting aside optimism vs. pessimism), effective communication identifies actual ways of being, thinking, talking and (especially!) doing. Don't just focus on the constraints that climate action creates, also explore the possibilities it opens up.
- _It's OK not to know everything_. Climate change is a huge topic. We often need to make changes on the basis of knowledge that feels very fragmentary.

## 8. What are the major contributors to global warming? ##

This can be answered in different ways. 
 
**(a)** You can break it down in terms of **gases**. A variety of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and others) contribute to global warming. Carbon is a big contributor (methane in second place), and so other gases are often translated into their carbon equivalents. In this toolkit, we use carbon footprint as shorthand for all greenhouse gas emissions, direct and indirect. 

**(b)** Carbon footprint can also often broken down by **country**, and this is important for climate negotiations (the UN COPs etc.). But whenever looking at breakdowns by country, check three things. First, emissions are usually calculated on a production basis, i.e. how much carbon is emitted within national borders. So countries like China appear to be heavy polluters, whereas countries like the UK [seem to be doing well](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/production-vs-consumption-co2-emissions?country=~GBR), because the UK produces lots of goods produced overseas, whose carbon emissions go on other countries' balance sheets. However, country emissions can be accounted in other ways, to include imports. Second, these rankings typically don't reflect historic emissions --- some countries (like the UK) may appear like they are leading the charge on climate change, but are very much the ones who [got us into this fix to begin with](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change). Third, don't forget about population sizes, and check on both absolute and per capita figures. 

**(c)** It can also be illuminating to break down carbon emissions by **sector**. Energy use for transport, within buildings, and for industrial processes accounts for a large proportion of emissions. Agriculture, forestry and other land use is also substantial. There is a [fuller breakdown here](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector). Keep in mind that some of these may be easier to abate than others. 

**(d)** Finally, it can be useful to break down emissions according to **wealth**. Sometimes climate change has been misleadingly blamed on overpopulation. According to [Kartha et al. (2020)](https://www.sei.org/publications/the-carbon-inequality-era/), nearly half of emissions growth between 1990 and 2015 was attributable to the richest 10%, and the impact of the poorest half was 'practically negligible'.

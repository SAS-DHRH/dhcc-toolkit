&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The digital is material. As digital humanists, every project we create, every software application we use, every piece of hardware we purchase impacts our environment. [&amp;hellip;] As humanities researchers, it is also our role to probe the values, the power structures, and the future imaginaries that underpin sustainable solutions.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To meet climate targets, the world needs to cut net carbon emissions by about half by 2030, and achieve net zero carbon by 2050. Globally, Information Communication Technology (ICT) already contributes 1.8% to 3.9% of greenhouse gas emissions, and is currently projected to grow significantly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100340">(Freitag et al. 2021)&lt;/a>. Transport accounts for about 14% &lt;a href="https://tcc-gsr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.1-Global-Transport-and-Climate-Change.pdf">(SLOCAT 2021)&lt;/a>, and research often involves heavy travel for conferences, meetings, and fieldwork. What can we do?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I Want To ...</title><link>/toolkit/decision-trees.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/toolkit/decision-trees.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="i-want-to-">

We hope to include some visual decision support tools in this section in the future. These might draw especially on the evidence and recommendations in the Working Practices and Project Planning sections. If you're interested in contributing to this section, please get in touch, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/SAS-DHRH/dhcc-toolkit/issues/35">join the conversation here&lt;/a>.

Our first step below is to build a list of needs, and to signpost relevant evidence and recommendations within the toolkit.


&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;h2 id="i-want-to-organise-an-online-event">
 I want to organise an online event
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#i-want-to-organise-an-online-event">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>See section on &lt;a href="https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/working-practices.html#communication-methods">Communication Methods&lt;/a> for more information on videoconferencing.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you are delivering the event as part of a funded project, make sure you include environmental considerations in your application. See &lt;a href="https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/grant-writing.html">Grant Writing&lt;/a> for more details.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As well as videoconferencing, consider what other computing processes will be involved in running your event. These may include:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Creating a website. See &lt;a href="https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html">Minimal Computing&lt;/a>, and in particular, sections on &lt;a href="https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#static-site-generators">Static Site Generators&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#tips">Tips for Sustainable Websites&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/minimal-computing.html#system-change">Critical Design and Systems Change&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>‘We use “minimal computing” to refer to computing done under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, &lt;strong>or other factors&lt;/strong>.’&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/">GO:DH Minimal Computing group&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This section introduces you to minimal computing principles.

It offers an important set of thinking tools to make responsible, frugal, and nuanced digital decisions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Maximal Computing</title><link>/toolkit/maximal-computing.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/toolkit/maximal-computing.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="maximal-computing">
 Maximal Computing

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This section introduces you to &amp;ldquo;maximal computing,&amp;rdquo; which refers to any &lt;strong>computationally
intensive work&lt;/strong>, including working with AI, blockchains, and big data.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="book-hint info">
 
&lt;h2> Key Recommendations &lt;/h2>
&lt;li> Develop a clear understanding of when it is appropriate to use AI and distributed systems (e.g. blockchain) for your opportunity, challenge, or research question.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> When you do need to use maximal computing, consider using less-intensive processes like using smaller models and adapting existing infrastructures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> Understand how to use efficiency metrics like T-scores, confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, Area under the ROC curve, LOGLOSS.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> Consider doing an Algorithmic Impact Assessment before developing or making substantial use of an AI tool.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> Engage critically with Big Tech, and examine the sustainability implications of mainstreaming deep learning AI in the future.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>How do we apply digital sufficiency, or digital sobriety, in an era of intense commercial and geopolitical competition around AI? Maximal computing systems are everywhere these days. For example, AI
is used in content generation, search, speech recognition, translation,
computer vision, and many other areas. In many parts of the world, AI is
present within our homes, cars, mobile phones. New applications of AI
are being implemented with the help of large publicly open datasets,
available on the web (for example open crawl), which in turn are fed to
models trained with huge hardware capabilities (training on GPUs and
TPUs). Such maximal computing may help with adaptation to climate
change; Gordon S. Blair gives the example of flooding resilience:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Grant Writing</title><link>/toolkit/grant-writing.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/toolkit/grant-writing.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="grant-writing">

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The research process represents a long path of decision-making that can and should involve assessment of the project or activity&amp;rsquo;s environmental footprint. This section is intended to help you make informed decisions about the research process as a whole, from using devices to communicating with your team. See also the &lt;a href="https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/decision-trees.html">Decision Trees&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/grant-writing.html">Grant Writing&lt;/a> sections.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="book-hint info">
 
&lt;h2> Key Recommendations &lt;/h2>
&lt;li> The easiest way to reduce your devices' impact on the enviroment is to use them longer, so use a resource such as &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/">iFixit&lt;/a> to investigate their longevity and repairability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> Many new convenient technologies, such as 5G and videoconferencing, come with increased data traffic, which means more carbon cost.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Our institutions are taking action. Most European universities have now set net zero targets and milestones, as part of broader sustainability strategies. They are integrating climate risks and opportunities into governance and strategy, and embedding climate change across their curriculums. Within institutions like these, advocacy is not about putting climate change on the agenda.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Climate Change FAQs</title><link>/toolkit/climate-change-faqs.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/toolkit/climate-change-faqs.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="climate-change-faqs">

&lt;p>Carbon and other greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere (especially from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal). Some emissions are then safely removed again (e.g. absorbed by trees), but some hang around in the atmosphere. This traps the sun&amp;rsquo;s energy in our planetary climate, causing average planetary temperatures to rise (called global warming or global heating). The consequences already include wildfires, droughts, loss of soil moisture, famines, disease, heatwaves, loss of arctic ice and rising sea levels, ocean acidification, storms, floods, wildlife extinction, and more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Teaching</title><link>/toolkit/teaching.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/toolkit/teaching.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="teaching">

&lt;p>This is a card-based game, loosely based on the contents of the DHCC Toolkit. A &lt;a href="https://github.com/SAS-DHRH/dhcc-toolkit/blob/main/static/2025-01_DHCC_Sustainability-Card-Game-Workshop.pdf">guide to running a DHCC Workshop based on the Sustainability Card Game can be viewed here&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VFoeZn7GrryuSp2gGgEWF4S6ALlhueNu/view?usp=drive_link">cards can be viewed here&lt;/a>, and the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wc1cLBB-Pwl8qLGnZ9X0qvcul0hCGmWxQf0iQAtJqCs/edit?usp=sharing">rules here&lt;/a>. Players take the roles of organisations competing (and perhaps collaborating) to become more digitally sustainable. Two hours, and 3-10 participants, is about right, although it is flexible: we&amp;rsquo;ve played it with groups of 15-20 too.

&lt;h3> Highlights &lt;/h3>
&lt;li> GLAM sector organisations face many challenges in decarbonisation, including need for financial support to decarbonise, and expertise in carbon accounting and management planning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> Carbon accounting and management support needs to be offered accessibly and at scale, and there is a role for automated approaches to help this happen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> Interdisciplinary academic expertise, including fields like the digital humanities, AI ethics, critical data studies, and political ecology, can usefully inform the further development of carbon accounting platforms and tools.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.hampshireculture.org.uk/">Hampshire Cultural Trust&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> (HCT) is an independent charity that manages and supports visitor attractions, museums, art galleries and arts centres across the UK county of Hampshire. The trust runs a wide variety of workshops, classes, events and exhibitions, welcomes over 15,000 children every year to its immersive education programme, and runs projects with individuals, groups and communities that would otherwise not have access to culture. In addition, the trust cares for 2.5 million objects relating to Hampshire’s rich history. It employs around 140 staff and has over 400 volunteers.
HCT has made a concerted effort to better understand and improve its environmental impact since 2019. Rolling, detailed action plans for the next 12 months have been developed, and a dedicated project team has been set up – 12-14 people from across the organisation, all of whom dedicate half a day per week to HCT’s environmental action.
With the support of a small &lt;a href="https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/our-main-funds-and-areas-of-support/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/higher-education-innovation-fund/">HEIF&lt;/a> grant via the University of Sussex, we — Josephine Lethbridge and Jo Lindsay Walton, with support from other DHCC members — were able to engage with HCT in 2023 to find out about their approach to decarbonisation and to offer support. This support included bringing in the carbon accounting platform &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://greenly.earth/en-gb">Greenly&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> (see below) as a project partner.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
